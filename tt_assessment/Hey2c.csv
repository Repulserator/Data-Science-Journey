To win a defamation case, you need to prove a few things. Most importantly, you need to prove the statements were false and that they were made with actual malice, otherwise known as a reckless disregard for the truth.', 'In a major pretrial ruling on March 31, Delaware Superior Court Judge Eric Davis ruled Dominion had successfully proven that all 20 statements mentioned in its lawsuit against Fox were false.', '“Through its extensive proof, Dominion has met its burden of showing there is no genuine issue of material fact as to falsity… The evidence developed in this civil proceeding demonstrates that is CRYSTAL clear that none of the Statements relating to Dominion about the 2020 election are true,”\xa0Davis wrote.', 'Dominion Voting Systems’ co-lead counsel Justin Nelson said he and Dominion’s other attorneys were expecting to go to trial\xa0against Fox News\xa0on Tuesday.', 'The final deal\xa0to settle the case with the right-wing network for $787.5 million\xa0came late in the day, and the settlement papers with Fox were signed just “minutes” before the agreement was announced, he said.', 'Prior to the last-minute settlement, Nelson told CNN he and other attorneys had been preparing opening statements – even during the two-and-a-half-hour\xa0courtroom\xa0delay after the lunch recess.', 'Fox News will pay more than $787 million to Dominion Voting Systems after lawyers from both sides hammered out a last-minute settlement of the defamation case launched against the right-wing network.', 'The deal was announced hours after the jury was sworn in at the Delaware Superior Court.

Let’s\xa0remember, by its own estimation, Dominion valued the entire\xa0company at somewhere between $30\xa0and $80 million. This settlement\xa0is 10 times the value of\xa0Dominion as an entire company. That’s how strong a statement this is with this number,” Honig explained.', 'Dominion Voting Systems still has pending lawsuits against right-wing networks Newsmax and OAN, as well as against Trump allies Rudy Giuliani, Sidney Powell and Mike Lindell.', 'All of these parties and entities deny wrongdoing and are fighting the lawsuits.', 'Following the announcement of a $787.5 million dollar settlement in the Fox News-Dominion case, John Poulos, the CEO of Dominion Voting Systems, said Fox News “admitted to telling lies” about the company.', '“Fox has admitted to telling lies about Dominion that caused enormous damage to my company, our employees, and the customers that we serve,” Poulos said.', '“Nothing can ever make up for that,” Poulos added at a news conference following court.', '“I cannot thank the election officials that we serve enough. Without them, there is no democracy,” he said.', 'Fox News has issued a statement on its settlement with Dominion Voting Systems acknowledging that some of the right-wing network’s on-air statements about Dominion were false.', '“We are pleased to have reached a settlement of our dispute with Dominion Voting Systems. We acknowledge the Court’s rulings finding certain claims about Dominion to be false. This settlement reflects FOX’s continued commitment to the highest journalistic standards. We are hopeful that our decision to resolve this dispute with Dominion amicably, instead of the acrimony of a divisive trial, allows the country to move forward from these issues,” the statement said.', 'For context: The statement was referring to\xa0Judge Eric Davis’ recent ruling\xa0that 20 Fox News broadcasts from late 2020 contained blatantly untrue assertions that Dominion rigged the presidential election. But Fox won’t have to admit on-air that it spread lies about Dominion, a Dominion representative told CNN.', 'The settlement between Fox News and Dominion Voting Systems totals $787,500,000, according to Dominion attorney\xa0Justin\xa0Nelson.', 'The settlement represents “vindication and accountability,” Nelson said in a news conference Tuesday afternoon.', '“The truth matters, lies have\xa0consequences,” Nelson said', '“Over two years\xa0ago, a torrent of lies swept\xa0Dominion and election officials\xa0across America into an\xa0alternative universe of\xa0conspiracy theories, causing\xa0grievous harm,” Nelson added.', 'Delaware Superior Court Judge Eric Davis praised both sides after they abruptly settled the defamation case between Fox News and Dominion Voting Systems at the last second.', 'He said, “I have been on the bench since 2010… I think this is the best lawyering I’ve had, ever.”', '“I would be proud to be your judge in the future,” Davis said, his final words before leaving the bench.', 'The hearing is now over.

And without you, the parties would not have been able to resolve their situation,” the judge told the jurors, before dismissing them.', 'The settlement was apparently brokered while the trial was on the brink of opening statements in Wilmington, Delaware.', 'After swearing in the jury earlier Tuesday, an unexplained hours-long delay paused proceedings in court, which yet again triggered rampant speculation that a deal was quietly in the works.', 'What this means: The last-minute deal means the closely watched case is effectively over and won’t proceed to trial. By settling with Dominion, influential Fox News executives and prominent on-air personalities will be\xa0spared from testifying\xa0about their 2020 election coverage, which was filled with lies about voter fraud.', 'Details of the settlement\xa0were not immediately available and might never become public.', 'More on the case: In its lawsuit, Dominion sought $1.6 billion in damages from Fox News. The right-wing network argued vociferously in pretrial proceedings that this number was inflated and\xa0didn’t come close\xa0to accurately capturing the potential losses that Dominion could have suffered as a result of Fox’s 2020 broadcasts.', 'Fox News and Fox Corporation — its parent company, which was also a defendant — say they never defamed Dominion, and say the case is a meritless assault on press freedoms. They denied Dominion’s claim that they promoted these election conspiracies to save their falling ratings after the 2020 election.', 'While the Dominion case is now over, Fox News is still facing a second\xa0major defamation lawsuit\xa0from Smartmatic, another voting technology company that was smeared on Fox shows after the 2020 election.

Moments later, they walked back into court together. It is not known what they privately discussed, if anything.', 'The lawyers — Fox attorney Dan Webb and Dominion attorney Justin Nelson —subsequently huddled at Dominion’s table for a few minutes, in public view.

The dispute escalated after audiotapes emerged of Fox host Maria Bartiromo talking to Rudy Giuliani in 2020.', '“The investigation should include a determination whether Fox News Network, LLC and Fox Corporation complied with their discovery obligations,” Delaware Superior Court Judge Eric Davis wrote.', 'The order, which was posted on the docket earlier in the day as jury selection began in the trial, directed attorney John Elzufon to lead the inquiry. Elzufon previously served as\xa0special\xa0master\xa0to handle routine evidentiary issues in the case.', 'Elzufon is required to finish his probe and submit a report by May 15.', 'The judge’s order indicates that the\xa0special\xa0master\xa0has the power to take depositions as part of his inquiry – and the\xa0special\xa0master\xa0will be allowed to depose anyone he thinks is appropriate.', 'Fox is required to pay for all expenses related to the investigation, according to Davis’ order.', 'Fox lawyers say they never withheld anything from Dominion, and that when new evidence emerged at a late stage, they turned it over as quickly as possible.', 'The court in the Dominion-Fox defamation trial reconvened as planned at 1:30 p.m. ET in Wilmington, Delaware, after a lunch break, but there has been an unexplained slowdown in the proceedings.', 'The trial has not yet moved to opening statements, though that is expected next.', 'Lawyers for both sides have been present in the courtroom since things reconvened about one hour ago.', 'They have been looking at their phones, talking among their colleagues and waiting.', 'The jury is not inside the courtroom.', 'The court is back in session after a lunch break and opening statements are expected to begin soon in the historic defamation lawsuit brought by election technology company Dominion Voting Systems against Fox News.', 'Here’s what you need to know about the high-stakes case:', 'Why is Dominion suing Fox News? Dominion\xa0sued Fox News in 2021\xa0over the right-wing network’s repeated promotion of false claims about the company, including that its voting machines rigged the 2020 election by flipping millions of ballots from Donald Trump to Joe Biden. Most of the 20 allegedly defamatory broadcasts mentioned in the lawsuit occurred in November and December 2020.', 'The company alleges that people at Fox News acted with actual malice and “recklessly disregarded the truth” when they spread this disinformation about Dominion. To prove “actual malice,” Dominion must convince a jury that people at Fox News who were responsible for these 20 broadcasts knew the Dominion claims were false or recklessly disregarded evidence of falsity\xa0— but\xa0put them on-air\xa0anyway.', 'According to Dominion’s theory of the case, Fox promoted these election conspiracy theories because “the lies were good for Fox’s business.” Dominion’s suit specifically zeroed in on shows hosted by Lou Dobbs, Maria Bartiromo, Tucker Carlson, Sean Hannity, and Jeanine Pirro.\xa0 Dominion said that as a result of Fox’s “orchestrated defamatory campaign” it has suffered “enormous and irreparable economic harm” and that its employees have been subjected to\xa0death threats and harassment.', 'What is Fox’s defense? Fox said it didn’t defame anyone and that the case is a meritless assault on press freedoms.', 'A spokesperson for Fox has said the network “is proud of our 2020 election coverage” and that its coverage “stands in the highest tradition of American journalism.” The company said, “Dominion’s lawsuit is a political crusade in search of a financial windfall, but the real cost would be cherished First Amendment rights.”', 'Fox has also accused Dominion of generating “noise and confusion” around the case, stating, “the core of this case remains about freedom of the press and freedom of speech, which are fundamental rights afforded by the Constitution,” specifically the First Amendment.', 'Fox has attempted to get the lawsuit tossed. But in a major blow to the right-wing network last month, the judge overseeing the case has allowed it to go to trial. He has also\xa0prohibited Fox\xa0from invoking some key First Amendment defenses, finding they were without merit.', 'What is Dominion asking for? Dominion is seeking $1.6 billion in damages. They say Fox’s on-air lies destroyed its reputation and is causing election officials to cancel their Dominion contracts. CNN\xa0recently reported\xa0on the growing distrust in voting machines in heavily Republican counties.', 'What are the trial logistics? The trial is expected to last five to six weeks and will be overseen by Delaware Superior Court Judge Eric M. Davis, who was appointed to the state bench in 2012 by a Democratic governor.\xa0A panel of 12 jurors and 12 alternates is being seated.', 'Cameras are not allowed in the courtroom and there will not be any video of the proceedings. There also won’t be any still photography inside the courtroom.', 'Who is expected to testify? Expected witness include Fox Corporation executives\xa0Rupert Murdoch\xa0and his son Lachlan Murdoch; Fox News CEO Suzanne Scott and president Jay Wallace; prominent TV hosts Tucker Carlson, Sean Hannity, Maria Bartiromo, Lou Dobbs, Jeanine Pirro, and Bret Baier,\xa0among others.', 'Dominion said it might also call Viet Dinh, Fox’s chief legal officer, and former House Speaker Paul Ryan, a Fox board member, to the witness stand.', 'Both sides are also hoping to put on testimony from their handpicked experts who specialize in election statistics, the security of voting machines, journalism ethics, the impact of disinformation in public discourse, and more.', 'Read more about the case here.', 'Delaware Superior Court Judge Eric Davis has ruled in Dominion Voting Systems’ favor on key questions about Fox News’ defense, blocking the cable network from making some First Amendment arguments and from bringing up certain pieces of evidence.', 'The judge ruled that Fox can’t bring up broadcasts where reporters accurately fact-checked Trump’s lies about the 2020 election in an effort to prove that other broadcasts that amplified those lies weren’t defamatory.', 'Those other broadcasts “are not relevant” to the case, Davis said, because “you can’t absolve yourself of defamation by putting someone else on at a different time” who told the truth about Dominion.', 'The judge also ruled that Fox can’t use internal Dominion emails where its staffers said their products “suck” and were “riddled with bugs,” to prove that there were real concerns about Dominion machines. Those emails weren’t public in 2020, so they couldn’t have influenced the state of mind of Fox staffers when they promoted the Dominion claims on their shows.', 'But if Dominion wins and the case moves to damages, Fox can bring up these emails to show that Dominion might be losing business because of voting security concerns and not just because of alleged defamation.', 'Meanwhile, Davis has cleared the way for Dominion to bring up Fox’s financial information at the trial, including details about salaries of top hosts and executives. Fox tried to block this from the trial, arguing that salaries aren’t linked to ratings, and that this data could bias the jury against the network.', '“Economics are relevant,” Davis said.', 'Despite what appeared on air, Fox News executives and hosts privately criticized the Trump camp for pushing claims of election fraud.', 'In an email between Fox Corporation chairman Rupert Murdoch and News Corporation CEO Robert Thomson, Murdoch’s real-time reaction to pro-Trump election deniers\xa0Rudy Giuliani and Sidney Powell’s press conference\xa0is captured. Murdoch controls Fox Corporation and News Corporation.', '“Really crazy stuff. And damaging,” Murdoch wrote in an email on November 19, 2020. Still, Giuliani and Powell returned to Fox shows promoting the same false claims.', 'The email is among the private text messages and emails that were released as part of Dominion Voting Systems’ defamation lawsuit against Fox News.', 'The defamation suit brought against Fox News by Dominion Voting Systems could have significant ramifications for the right-wing cable channel.', 'Opening statements are expected to begin soon in the trial, and both sides will get a chance to speak in court and present their case.', 'After former President Donald Trump lost the 2020 presidential election to Joe Biden, Dominion, which is an election technology company, alleges Fox pushed various pro-Trump conspiracy theories because “the lies were good for Fox’s business.” The coverage included false and potentially damaging claims about the company’s voting technology, according to Dominion.', 'Fox is arguing that it was merely reporting claims made by the Trump administration and Trump’s associates. It says this case is about protecting “the rights of the free press” and that a verdict in favor of Dominion would have “grave consequences” for the fourth estate.', '“Dominion’s lawsuit is a political crusade in search of a financial windfall, but the real cost would be cherished First Amendment rights,” a Fox spokesperson said in a\xa0statement.', 'What the jury has to consider: Defamation cases are hard to win in the United States, because of the Supreme Court’s ruling in New York Times v. Sullivan in 1964.', 'Defamation has to meet a high standard. An entity can’t have just lied, it must have known (or at least strongly suspected) it was lying at the time, and it has to have been done with “actual malice.”', 'The court has already ruled on the first two, saying Fox aired lies and knew they were lies. So instead of a trial on the comments’ veracity, the jury will be asked to consider whether Fox made the claims maliciously.', 'Limits on Fox’s defense: The judge has already\xa0rejected several of Fox’s First Amendment defenses,\xa0and in pretrial rulings barred the network from arguing its guests’ allegedly defamatory statements were “newsworthy” and deserving of coverage.', 'As the Fox News defamation trial kicks off, the judge instructed the newly sworn-in jury to avoid media coverage of the high-stakes case and focus on the evidence presented inside the courtroom.', 'Delaware Superior Court Judge Eric Davis told jurors they need to “reach a just verdict regardless of the consequences.”', '“Do not let rumors, suspicion, or anything else… influence you in any way,” Davis added.', 'He also gave them the typical instructions for jurors — like not to watch any TV coverage about the trial.', '“If there is publicity about this trial, you must ignore and not read anything or listen to any television or radio programs about the case must decide the case,” Davis said.\xa0“During the trial, you should keep an open mind and should not form or express any opinion about the case.”', 'The jury is now on a lunch break. Opening statements are expected after lunch.', 'Dominion Voting Systems will no longer try to prove that it lost $600 million in contracts and profits\xa0because of Fox News’ election lies — but the company is still seeking $1.6 billion in overall damages and is adjusting how it will pursue that eye-popping payout at trial.', 'On Monday, Fox News publicly asserted that Dominion had reduced its damages claims, down to roughly $1 billion, citing an email that Dominion sent Friday to Fox’s lawyers. But the voting technology company maintains that the number hasn’t changed.', '“The damages claim remains. As Fox well knows, our damages exceed $1.6 billion,” a Dominion spokesperson said Monday in a statement.', 'But what has apparently changed is how Dominion will try to win those damages with the jury.', 'Since Dominion sued Fox in 2021, the company has claimed that it sustained about $600 million in lost contracts and profits, plus an additional $1 billion in reputational damage to the company’s value.', 'It now appears that Dominion will argue the entire $1.6 billion came from reputational losses, instead of partially from canceled contracts. It’s unclear why Dominion is making this last-minute shift in its strategy.', 'Fox has aggressively pushed back on Dominion’s damages claim and says the $1.6 billion figure is massively inflated. Fox lawyers have argued that Dominion can’t prove the losses that it is claiming.', '“There’s also a problem that a huge chunk of their lost profits is coming from business they haven’t actually lost,” Fox lawyer Erin Murphy said at a hearing last month.', 'As an example, Murphy pointed to a Louisiana contract where she said Dominion was “claiming lost profits on the basis of something they haven’t lost.” The network’s court filings have cited a deposition from Dominion’s CFO saying the Louisiana deal is on hold because of a competitor, not because of Fox.', 'Dominion’s original lawsuit said, “Louisiana recently cancelled its reassessment and bid process, essentially prohibiting Dominion from securing a new $100-million-plus contract.”', 'In a private text message conversation with an unknown person, two days before the January 6 attack, Fox News host Tucker Carlson said, “We are very, very close to being able to ignore Trump most nights. I truly can’t wait.”', 'Legal filings made public on March 7 in the Dominion defamation case included private text messages, emails and deposition transcripts.', 'Carlson added of Trump in the same exchange, “I hate him passionately.” The Fox host said of the Trump presidency, “That’s the last four years. We’re all pretending we’ve got a lot to show for it, because admitting what a disaster it’s been is too tough to digest. But come on. There isn’t really an upside to Trump.”', 'For all the interest in big-name witnesses and eye-opening private text messages, at the core of the\xa0defamation lawsuit filed by Dominion Voting Systems\xa0against Fox News are 20 specific broadcasts and tweets in which the voting company says Fox knowingly promoted lies, destroying its reputation.', 'According to the lawsuit, all 20 statements took place between November 8, 2020, and January 26, 2021, and came in the form of on-air comments from Fox hosts Jeanine Pirro, Lou Dobbs and Maria Bartiromo; interviews with prominent pro-Trump election deniers Sidney Powell, Rudy Giuliani and Mike Lindell; and several of Dobbs’ tweets.', 'The wild allegations in the statements fell into four broad categories: that Dominion conducted election fraud, that it used algorithms to flip votes, that it had ties to Venezuela and that politicians received kickbacks to use the company.', 'The judge overseeing the defamation trial has already\xa0ruled that these allegations were false, saying it is “CRYSTAL clear that none of the Statements relating to Dominion about the 2020 election are true.”', 'At trial, it will be a jury’s job to determine if the statements were made with “actual malice” – a high bar based on knowing falseness or having a reckless disregard for the truth – and potentially award damages. Dominion has asked for $1.6 billion in damages and additional punitive damages, a number Fox says is wildly overblown.', 'Fox has denied wrongdoing and said the case is a meritless assault on press freedoms. Lawyers for Fox have argued that Dominion hasn’t come close to clearing the high bar to prove defamation.', 'Here’s a closer look at those 20 specific broadcasts and tweets of alleged defamation.', 'Dominion Voting Systems wants Fox network’s star hosts and top executives to appear on the witness stand during trial, it said in a court filing in March.', 'In April, Delaware Superior Court Judge Eric Davis said Dominion\xa0could compel Fox Corporation Chairman Rupert Murdoch and his son, CEO Lachlan Murdoch, to testify, in a big blow to Fox.', '“Both parties have made these witnesses very relevant,” Davis said, regarding the Murdochs. Fox was trying to block Dominion from having the Murdochs on the witness stand.', 'Here’s who else could appear as witnesses, if Dominion gets its way:', 'After swearing in the jury in the historic Fox-Dominion trial, Delaware Superior Court Judge Eric Davis gave the jury standard warnings not to discuss the case or do any of their own research about it.', '“You have to fight human nature,” Davis said. “You can’t talk about the case, among yourselves… at any time until final deliberations…\xa0it’s hard, but you do have to fight human nature.”', 'He also told the jurors that they’re not allowed to do any independent research about the case.', '“Do not do any detective work,” Davis said, adding, “You have to limit yourself to what’s in the courtroom.”', 'The judge in the Fox-Dominion trial issued a stern warning Tuesday to the people inside the courtroom, reminding them that photography is not permitted after a Fox News staffer broke the rules.', '“If you violate the protocol order… you will be escorted out,” Delaware Superior Court Judge Eric Davis said, adding, “I personally think you should be – something else.”', 'The judge’s rebuke came after a Fox News spokeswoman snapped a picture from inside the courtroom before the court was in session.

Rumors of a settlement swirled in the courthouse when, after a lunch break, the proceedings dramatically ground to a halt for nearly three hours with no explanation, while the parties apparently hammered out an accord.', '“The parties have resolved their case,” Judge Eric Davis said, before dismissing the 12-member jury, crediting them with giving the parties an impetus to reach a settlement, effusively praising the lawyers from both sides, and gaveling out the so-called media “trial of the century” before it could even begin.', 'The groundbreaking settlement “represents vindication and accountability,” Dominion lawyer Justin Nelson said. “For our democracy to endure for another 250 years, and hopefully much longer, we must share a commitment to facts… Today represents a ringing endorsement for truth and for democracy.”', 'The right-wing network said in a statement that it “acknowledge[s] the Court’s rulings finding certain claims about Dominion to be false,” referring to Davis’ recent ruling that 20 Fox News broadcasts from late 2020 contained blatantly untrue assertions that Dominion rigged the presidential election. But Fox won’t have to admit on-air that it spread lies about Dominion, a Dominion representative told CNN.', 'The $787.5 million payout is roughly half of the $1.6 billion that Dominion initially sought, though it is nearly 10 times the company’s valuation from 2018, and roughly eight times its annual revenue in 2021, according to court filings.', 'The last-minute agreement means the closely watched case is over and won’t proceed to trial. By settling with Dominion, influential Fox News executives and prominent on-air personalities will be spared from testifying about their 2020 election coverage, which was filled with lies about voter fraud.', 'The witness list included Fox Corporation chairman Rupert Murdoch, his CEO son Lachlan Murdoch, and top Fox hosts like Sean Hannity and Tucker Carlson. Damning emails, texts, and deposition testimony made public during the case revealed that these figures, and many others at Fox, privately said in 2020 that the vote-rigging claims against Dominion were asinine.

It’s hard to see how a rookie speaker, with a tiny majority and a conference containing plenty of extremists, can engineer either of these outcomes.', 'Most countries don’t require the legislature to raise the government’s borrowing threshold. But the quirky situation in the US has made a once routine duty an opportunity for political mischief in a polarized age. Since the government spends more than it makes in revenue, it must borrow money to service its debt and pay for spending that Congress has already authorized. It has no problem getting more credit since the US pays its bills and has always had a stellar credit rating, despite one previous downgrade from the threat of default.', 'At least, that’s the way it has worked until now.', 'McCarthy beseeched his conference in a closed-door meeting on Tuesday to line up behind a bill that would raise the debt limit for a year but require a flurry of spending concessions from Biden. He styled the measure as an initial way of forcing the president to the negotiating table. But the bill is purely tactical since it’s got no chance of passing the Democratic-led Senate.', 'But in a sign of how difficult it will be for the speaker to even pull this gambit off, there were signs of internal disagreement on what should be in the package among GOP members.', 'Rep. Scott Perry, the chairman of the hardline House Freedom Caucus, was frustrated about a lack of specificity in the plan and wanted steeper cuts.', '“I don’t know what’s in the package completely. That’s the issue,” Perry told reporters. Some members seem reluctant to commit so far. Conservative Rep. Tim Burchett told CNN’s Manu Raju, “I’m open to it but I’m still a ‘no’ vote.”', 'It is not unusual for various factions in a congressional majority to haggle over details before a final package is agreed. And House Financial Services Chair Patrick McHenry, a McCarthy ally, was confident the plan would pass the House. “The question is, what does the White House then do once we pass this package? We’ve clearly stated there is no clean debt ceiling that will pass the House,” he added. “So we’ll have the first opening offer here. And we’ll see if the president’s willing to come to the table and negotiate like previous presidents have.”', 'McHenry’s comment, however, reflected a big flaw in the GOP strategy since it relies on McCarthy’s belief that Biden will have no choice but to come to the table. The White House has insisted the House should do its job and pass a simple bill that only raises the borrowing limit', 'In effect, McCarthy has already set up a severe test of his leadership since there’s no guarantee that he can pass the measure in a House where he can only lose four votes and in which there are few signs the fractious GOP can agree on what programs to cut and by how much. And even if the measure does squeeze through the House in the coming weeks, it will likely be an idealized Republican product on which Biden and the Democratic Senate will never bite. Any subsequent package that emerged would almost certainly feature concessions that could splinter its GOP support.', 'Still, the speaker was typically bullish when he predicted Monday he’d have the votes to pass his initial bill.', '“I think we got 218 to raise the debt ceiling,” McCarthy told CNN. “We’ve got a lot of consensus within the conference. We’ll get together and work through it.”', 'House Republicans in talks over one-year debt ceiling plan in push to challenge White House', 'His assurances may not be very reassuring, however, because his similarly blithe predictions that he had the votes to win the speakership in January degenerated into a farcical process that saw him make huge concessions to his party’s most radical members and required 15 ballots before he finally won the job of his dreams.', 'But with the debt ceiling, it will be Americans’ livelihoods and the global economy, rather than McCarthy’s immediate political ambitions, that are on the line.', 'So far, Republicans seem to be having trouble negotiating with themselves, let alone Biden. Republican Rep. Dusty Johnson of South Dakota, who is helping to fashion the GOP’s position, said that while the party hopes to pass the initial bill next week, challenges remain.', '“I think the hardest part is just that there are an unlimited number of conservative policy victories that, of course, we all want to see worked in,” Johnson told CNN’s Manu Raju. “The reality is that in a negotiation, you never get everything you want. And so I think our biggest issue right now is how do we squeeze these thousands of desires down to a manageable and credible number of asks?”', 'House GOP escalates defense of Trump with New York field hearing seeking to discredit Manhattan DA', 'Another complication is that some members of the Republican conference have said they will never vote to raise the debt ceiling on principle – no matter what. In a powerful Republican majority such holdouts could be ignored. In McCarthy’s narrow majority – secured after a 2022 midterm election that fell short of GOP expectations – they have real leverage. And Democrats have little incentive to help McCarthy out in the event of GOP defections since they’d presumably have to vote for huge cuts that Biden has opposed in any final GOP bill. And the speaker probably couldn’t risk using Democratic votes anyway after agreeing to a rule, as he battled to win his job, that lets any single member call a vote on his ouster.', 'The coming showdown over the debt ceiling is potentially the defining moment in the two-year period of uneasy cohabitation between the Democratic president and Republican speaker. Neither Biden nor McCarthy can afford to lose, and the outcome will shape both their legacies.', 'There is nothing wrong with Republicans seeking to use the leverage they won in a democratic election to try to further their political goals of cutting public spending. There are some GOP lawmakers who sincerely worry about debt and deficits – even when their party runs government. Plenty of economists worry about the always ballooning national debt, which has crashed through $31 trillion. And Biden’s big spending on Covid relief packages, infrastructure, climate mitigation measures and health care programs triggered a debate on whether he worsened the inflation crisis.', 'But are Republicans choosing the right hill for this battle when jobs, market-linked pension plans and the economic well-being of millions are at risk? The absolutist nature of McCarthy’s position pays little heed to a delicate balance of power. Democrats control the White House and the Senate, so in handing Republicans the House, albeit barely, voters might have been seeking compromise rather than confrontation.', 'Republicans are also facing claims of hypocrisy, since they had little problem raising the debt limit when Donald Trump, who rarely worried about making a big spending splash, was president. The 45th commander in chief is also on videotape dating to his White House days saying he couldn’t believe anyone would use the debt ceiling as a “negotiating wedge.” Republicans notoriously turn into fiscal hawks when Democrats are in office but often look the other way when there is one of their own in the Oval Office.', 'In order to prevail in this fight, McCarthy has to somehow change the political dynamic by saddling Biden with the blame for any default and the economic tensions that could begin to unfold even before the country plunges over a fiscal cliff.', 'He tried to do so on Monday by insisting that the biggest threat to the US economy wasn’t a default but rising national debt.', '“Without exaggeration American debt is a ticking time bomb that will detonate unless we take serious responsible action. Yet, how has President Biden reacted to this issue? He has done nothing. So in my view, and I think the rest of America, it’s irresponsible,” he said.', 'Previous fiscal showdowns between GOP-controlled Congresses and Democratic presidents have often rebounded poorly on Republicans. Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, for example, branded their foes in the House as economic arsonists and thereby gained political traction.', 'McCarthy needs to reverse the equation, which is why he’s trying to portray Biden as stubborn in refusing to negotiate concessions for raising the debt ceiling. The two men haven’t met for the last 75 days and the White House is sticking to its position that the place for talks is over a budget – which House Republicans are yet to produce – and not with the full faith and credit of the US government on the line and with America’s reputation as a financial haven at stake.', 'McCarthy is, therefore, in a bind. Congress, not the president, has the power to raise the government’s borrowing limit. Yet the speaker is demanding Biden give away his store over a duty that only McCarthy and his lawmakers can fulfill. No one would benefit from a default – especially not a president likely heading into a reelection race. But it’s hard to see how McCarthy can emerge from this conundrum as the winner if he triggers an economic meltdown.', 'The White House twisted that particular knife on Monday.', '“There is one responsible solution to the debt limit: addressing it promptly, without brinksmanship or hostage taking – as Republicans did three times in the last administration and as Presidents Trump and Reagan argued for in office,” spokesman Andrew Bates said.', 'Republicans in the Senate have so far tried to avoid the mess. But Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell did at least give his colleague in the House some moral support on Monday when he returned to the Capitol after convalescing after a fall.', '“President Biden does not get to stick his fingers in his ears and refuse to listen, talk or negotiate. And the American people know that. The White House needs to stop wasting time and start negotiating with the Speaker of the House,” McConnell said, though notably didn’t volunteer to get involved.', 'McCarthy’s speech on Monday only furthered the impression that a damaging political crisis over the debt ceiling is, after months of simmering, moving toward a boil.', 'As Senate Democratic Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York put it on Monday: “He went all the way to Wall Street and gave us no more details, no more facts, no new information, and I’ll be blunt: If Speaker McCarthy continues in this direction we are headed to default.”', 'CNN’s Melanie Zanona, Morgan Rimmer, Haley Talbot and Lauren Fox contributed to this report.', '© 2024 Cable News Network.

I mean, this citizen went home and slept in his bed at night after shooting that young Black kid in the head,” Crump told CNN.', '“He merely rang the doorbell. That was it,” the teen’s attorney said. “And the owner of the home shoots through the door, hitting him in the head and then shoots him a second time.”', 'The mayor said he didn’t even know the details of the case until several days after the shooting.

A major takeaway of the new study is that misuse and sharing of stimulant prescription medications is happening in middle and high schools, not just college,” said Camenga, who was not involved with the study.', 'Published Tuesday in the journal JAMA Network Open, the study analyzed data collected between 2005 and 2020 by Monitoring the Future, a federal survey that has measured drug and alcohol use among secondary school students nationwide each year since 1975.', 'In the data set used for this study, questionnaires were given to more than 230,000 teens in eighth, 10th and 12th grades in a nationally representative sample of 3,284 secondary schools.', 'Adderall users struggle with ongoing shortage while reason -- and resolution -- remain uncertain', 'Schools with the highest rates of teens using prescribed ADHD medications were about 36% more likely to have students misusing prescription stimulants during the past year, the study found. Schools with few to no students currently using such treatments had much less of an issue, but it didn’t disappear, McCabe said.', '“We know that the two biggest sources are leftover medications, perhaps from family members such as siblings, and asking peers, who may attend other schools,” he said.', 'Schools in the suburbs in all regions of the United States except the Northeast had higher rates of teen misuse of ADHD medications, as did schools where typically one or more parent had a college degree, according to the study.', 'Schools with more White students and those who had medium levels of student binge drinking were also more likely to see teen abuse of stimulants.', 'On an individual level, students who said they had used marijuana in the past 30 days were four times as likely to abuse ADHD medications than teens who did not use weed, according to the analysis.', 'In addition, adolescents who said they used ADHD medications currently or in the past were about 2.5% more likely to have misused the stimulants when compared with peers who had never used stimulants, the study found.', '“But these findings were not being driven solely by teens with ADHD misusing their medications,” McCabe said. “We still found a significant association, even when we excluded students who were never prescribed ADHD therapy.”', 'Data collection for the study was through 2020. Since then, new statistics show prescriptions for stimulants surged 10% during 2021 across most age groups.  At the same time, there has been a nationwide shortage of Adderall, one of the most popular ADHD drugs, leaving many patients unable to fill or refill their prescriptions.', 'The stakes are high: Taking stimulant medications improperly over time can result in stimulant use disorder, which can lead to anxiety, depression, psychosis and seizures, experts say.', ""The benefits of 'body doubling' when you have ADHD, according to experts"", 'If overused or combined with alcohol or other drugs, there can be sudden health consequences.

They are “protective for the health of a child,” Camenga said. “Those adolescents diagnosed and treated correctly and monitored do very well — they have a lower risk of new mental health problems or new substance use disorders.”', 'The solution to the problem of stimulant misuse among middle and high school teens isn’t to limit use of the medications for the children who really need them, McCabe stressed.', '“Instead, we need to look very long and hard at school strategies that are more or less effective in curbing stimulant medication misuse,” he said. “Parents can make sure the schools their kids  attend have safe storage for medication and strict dispensing policies. And ask about prevalence of misuse — that data is available for every school.”', 'Families can also help by talking to their children about how to handle peers who approach them wanting a pill or two to party or pull an all-night study session, he added.', '“You’d be surprised how many kids do not know what to say,” McCabe said. “Parents can role-play with their kids to give them options on what to say so they are ready when it happens.”', 'Parents and guardians should always store controlled medications in a lockbox, and should not be afraid to count pills and stay on top of early refills, he added.', '“Finally, if parents suspect any type of misuse, they should contact their child’s prescriber right away,” McCabe said. “That child should be screened and assessed immediately.”', '© 2024 Cable News Network.

Alex Padilla, a California Democrat, said at a Judiciary Committee hearing for three lower court nominees on Tuesday. “It should go without saying that judges at all levels should be held to strict and enforceable ethical standards.”', 'Durbin said in a speech that Congress shouldn’t have to wait for the court to act.', '“The Supreme Court doesn’t need to wait on Congress to clean up its act; the justices could take action today if they wanted to, and if the court fails to act, Congress must,” Durbin, an Illinois Democrat, said on the Senate floor Tuesday.', 'Back-to back-reports in ProPublica this month detailed how luxury travel and gifts to Thomas from Crow – and even a real estate transaction – went unreported in Thomas’ annual financial disclosures.', 'Thomas has said that the travel and gifts to him and his family that were financed by the Crows went unreported because he had been advised that he was not required to do so, under an exemption in the court’s disclosure rules for so-called “personal hospitality.” After scrutiny of those rules by lawmakers, the Judicial Conference – which operates as the policy-making body for the federal judiciary – recently closed a loophole in those rules that appears to have covered some of the hospitality Thomas received. Thomas said that he intended to follow that updated guidance in the future, and a source close to the justice also told CNN in recent days that he planned to amend his disclosure form to report the real estate transaction, the sale of his mother’s home to Crow.', '“If the reports are accurate, it stinks,” Sen.

(It is also, apparently, National Animal Crackers Day for those who celebrate.)', 'Whether you have already filed your tax return or still need to, the good news is this tax filing season has gone much more smoothly than the past three, which were hurt by the pandemic.', '“This is the first tax season since 2019 where the IRS and the nation were on normal footing,” IRS Commissioner Danny Werfel said in a call with reporters.', 'For instance, Werfel noted that since January, thanks to an infusion of some new funding after years of budget cuts, IRS employees have been able to answer 87% of calls from filers with questions. Last year, they answered fewer than 15%. And the wait times on those phone calls dropped to just 4 minutes this filing season from 27 minutes last filing season.', 'The agency also added a roster of new online tools for filers, he added.', 'Not everyone has to file on April 18: If you live in a federally declared disaster area, have a business there — or have relevant tax documents stored by businesses in that area — it’s likely the IRS has already extended the filing and payment deadlines for you. Here is where you can find the specific extension dates for each disaster area.', 'Not everyone has to file on April 18: If you live in a federally declared disaster area, have a business there — or have relevant tax documents stored by businesses in that area — it’s likely the IRS has already extended the filing and payment deadlines for you. Here is where you can find the specific extension dates for each disaster area.', 'Thanks to many rounds of extreme weather in recent months, for instance, tax filers in most of California — which accounts for 10% to 15% of all federal filers — have already been granted an extension until Oct. 16 to file and to pay, according to an IRS spokesperson.', 'If you’re in the armed forces and are currently or were recently stationed in a combat zone, the filing and payment deadlines for your 2022 taxes are most likely extended by 180 days. But your specific extended filing and payment deadlines will depend on the day you leave (or left) the combat zone. This IRS publication offers more detail.', 'Taxes and adulting: What to know about filing taxes on your own for the first time', 'Lastly, if you made little to no money last year (typically less than $12,950 for single filers and $25,900 for married couples), you may not be required to file a return. But you may want to anyway if you think you are eligible for a refund thanks to, for instance, refundable tax credits such as the Earned Income Tax Credit. (Use this IRS tool to gauge whether you are required to file this year.) You also are likely eligible to use IRS Free File (intended for those with adjusted gross income of $73,000 or less) so it won’t cost you to submit a return.', 'Your paycheck may not be your only source of income: If you had one full-time job you may think that is the only income you made and have to report. But that’s not necessarily so.', 'Other potentially taxable and reportable income sources include:', 'Organize your tax documents: By now you should have received every tax document that third parties are required to send you (your employer, bank, brokerage, etc.).', 'If you don’t recall receiving a hard copy of a tax form in the mail, check your email and your online accounts — a document may have been sent to you electronically.', 'Here are some of the tax forms you may have received:', '“Be aware that there’s no form for some taxable income, like proceeds from renting out your vacation property, meaning you’re responsible for reporting it on your own,” according to the Illinois CPA Society.', 'One very last-minute way to reduce your 2022 tax bill: If you’re eligible to make a tax-deductible contribution to an IRA and haven’t done so for last year, you have until April 18 to contribute up to $6,000 ($7,000 if you’re 50 or older). That will reduce your tax bill and augment your retirement savings.', 'Proofread your return before submitting it: Do this whether you’re using tax software or working with a professional tax preparer.', 'Little mistakes and oversights delay the processing of your return (and the issuance of your refund if you’re owed one). You want to avoid things like having a typo in your name, birth date, Social Security number or direct deposit number; choosing the wrong filing status (e.g., married vs single); making a simple math error; or leaving a required field blank.', 'What to do if you can’t file by April 18: If you’re not able to file by next Tuesday, fill out Form 4868 electronically or on paper and send it in by April 18. You will be granted an automatic six-month extension to file.', ""Your tax refund may be smaller this year. Here's why"", 'Note, however, that an extension to file is not an extension to pay. You will be charged interest (currently running at 7%) and a penalty on any amount you still owe for 2022 but haven’t paid by April 18.', 'So if you suspect you still owe tax — perhaps you had some income outside of your job for which tax wasn’t withheld or you had a big capital gain last year — approximate how much more you owe and send that money to the IRS by Tuesday.', 'You can choose to do so by mail, attaching a check to your extension request form. Make sure your envelope is postmarked no later than April 18.', 'Or the more efficient route is pay what you owe electronically at IRS.gov, said CPA Damien Martin, a tax partner at EY. If you do that, the IRS notes you will not have to file a Form 4868. “The IRS will automatically process an extension of time to file,” the agency notes in its instructions.', 'If you opt to electronically pay directly from your bank account, which is free, select “extension” and then “tax year 2022” when given the option.', 'You can also pay by credit or debit card, but you will be charged a processing fee. Doing so, though, may become much more costly than just a fee if you charge your tax payment but don’t pay your credit card bill off in full every month, since you likely pay a high interest rate on outstanding balances.', 'If you can’t pay what you owe in full, the IRS does have some payment plan options. But it might be smart to first consult with a certified public accountant or a tax preparer who is an enrolled agent to make sure you are making the best choice for your circumstance.', 'If you still owe income taxes to your state, remember that you may need to go through a similar exercise of filing for an extension and making a payment to your state’s revenue department, Martin said.', 'Use this interactive tax assistant for basic questions you may have: The IRS provides an “interactive tax assistant” that can help you answer more than 50 basic questions pertaining to your individual circumstance on income, deductions, credits and other technical questions.', 'If you’ve already filed your return, you’re probably glad to have it in the rear view mirror. But you may still have a few questions about what’s ahead.', 'What about my refund? If you are due a refund, the IRS typically sends it within 21 days of receiving your return. When yours does arrive, it may be smaller than last year, even if your financial life didn’t change much. That’s because a number of Covid-related tax breaks expired.', 'So far, the average refund paid was $2,878 for the week ending April 7, down from $3,175 at the same point in last year’s filing season.', 'Will I be audited?: The reasons and methods for auditing a taxpayer can vary — and many audits result in “no change,” meaning you don’t end up owing anything more to the IRS. But one thing is common for the vast majority of US tax filers: Audit rates are exceedingly low.', 'For filers reporting incomes between $50,000 and $200,000, only 0.1% of them were audited in 2020, according to the latest data from the IRS. Even for very high income filers, audit rates were quite low: Just 0.4% for those reporting income of between $1 million and $5 million; 0.7% for those with income between $5 million and $10 million; and 2.4% for returns with income over $10 million.', 'Looking ahead, the IRS commissioner noted in a press call that the agency will be using money from the Inflation Reduction Act to bolster its compliance efforts to focus more on auditing high-income individuals — defined as making $400,000 or more. As for filers with income below that level, he said he did not anticipate any change in the likelihood they would be audited.', 'Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

For us, the loopholes are bigger and the rates are sometimes lower. Meanwhile, the rich keep getting richer, with the wealth of billionaires in particular growing by more than $1.5 trillion over the last few years.', 'This status quo is unfair, but even more importantly, it’s unsustainable. Such high levels of inequality are pushing our economy and our democracy to their breaking points. That’s why we should examine how we can set our country up for long-term stability and prosperity. And we should start by ensuring that the ultra-rich pay more of what they owe the country that made their success possible.', 'There are three changes to the tax code that would help us do just that:', 'Right now, the US tax system values money over sweat. If you work hard for your money instead of earning it passively, you’re essentially penalized for it. People who earn a salary pay significantly higher tax rates on their income than wealthy investors who passively earn capital gains income.', 'Inheriting money is an even better deal. Thanks to former president Donald Trump’s 2017 tax law, the first $12.92 million (or $25.84 million for a married couple) is completely exempt from any estate tax, and the stepped-up basis loophole allows wealthy families to permanently erase millions in capital gains taxes by resetting the market value of those assets to their value at the time of the original owner’s death. With this, it becomes relatively simple for the rich to inherit tens, even hundreds of millions of dollars, and pay almost nothing in taxes. Someone working for that money, on the other hand, would pay over a third of it in federal income taxes.', 'Opinion: The hard lessons I learned the first time I was laid off', 'Why do we have a tax code that says working people should be taxed more than wealthy investors and those who got rich just by virtue of being born into the right family? At the end of the day, money is money, whether you worked for it or whether you inherited it. As an heiress and an investor, we should not be paying lower tax rates than people who earn their money from working.', 'It’s time for the tax code to treat all income equally by taxing all capital gains over $1 million at the same rates as ordinary income, and replacing our loophole-ridden estate tax with a simpler inheritance tax that treats inherited wealth as income.', 'We can’t just focus on income, however, because many of the richest Americans earn basically no taxable income of any kind in a typical year. Capital gains are only taxed when assets are sold, so instead of selling them, the ultra-rich use their assets as collateral to borrow vast sums of money at extremely low interest rates to live on, and then declare little or even negative “income” on their tax forms. This “Buy, Borrow, Die” strategy is a major reason billionaires paid a lower effective tax rate over recent years than working-class families.', 'By rethinking what is taxable, we can get access to the trillions of dollars of billionaire wealth that is untouchable under our current tax structure. That’s why President Biden has proposed the Billionaire Minimum Income Tax, which would tax the unrealized capital gains of the wealthiest households and why others have proposed wealth taxes on billionaires.', 'Finally, one of the most straightforward changes needed is to simply tax the extremely rich more than the merely rich. Our income tax caps out at a top rate of 37% for any income over $578,125 (or $693,750 for married couples). No matter how much more someone makes, they’ll never pay more than 37% in federal income taxes.', 'While someone earning $600,000 is certainly making enough to live a very comfortable life, they’re in a different world than someone making $600 million a year. In order to reflect the real differences between the rich and the ultra-rich, we need to return to the top rates we had through the most prosperous decades of the 20th century and add significantly more tax brackets. They should reach up to 90% for people making more than $100 million a year.', 'Sign up for CNN Opinion’s newsletter.Join us on Twitter and Facebook', 'These three changes certainly won’t fix all our country’s problems on their own, but they would go a long way in stopping the steady flow of our country’s wealth toward a smaller and smaller group of people, a change that would make both our democracy and our economy more stable. The tax code can be a powerful tool for both social and economic change. We just need to use it more effectively.', '© 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

The state-funded mega-project cost close to $29 million, or 300 million Norwegian kroner.', '“We Norwegians are usually modest people,” Camilla Einarsen Heggernes, a spokesperson for rail company Bybanen Utbygging, tells CNN, “But in this instance we would say that the tunnel is 100% state of the art.”', 'It takes a little under 10 minutes to whizz through the tunnel by bike and around 40 if strolling by foot. To break up the monotony of the windowless tunnel, there are a variety of art installations throughout, as well as different colors and lighting to help users place where they are on the journey and offer a sense of direction.', 'At the center point is a “sundial” installation – where the sun definitely will never shine – which shows the time of day, again helping to orientate visitors and also to break up the otherwise long line of sight. The tunnel is otherwise perfectly straight, apart from slight curvatures at entrance and exit.', 'If you’re wondering how cyclists and pedestrians can use the same space, there are two lanes in the tunnel: a 3.5-meter wide bike lane and a 2.5-meter-wide lane for walkers and runners. “We have laid down a blue rubber flooring throughout the tunnel, similar to an athletic track, explains Einarsen Heggernes. “This makes it more pleasant to use than if one would just walk on asphalt.”', 'The man who cycled 870 miles for a croissant', 'The new tunnel came about as a byproduct of Bergen’s second Bybanen tram line, which opened in November 2022. The tram line through the mountain required a parallel evacuation tunnel, so the developers decided to make the new tunnel multipurpose.', 'Bergen is Norway’s second-largest city and the port city is linked to Oslo, the Norwegian capital, by the 496-kilometer Bergensbanen railway line. This stunning rail journey crosses Europe’s largest high mountain plateau, the Hardangervidda, and its snow-clad vistas were the backdrop for the battle scenes in the “Star Wars” sequel “The Empire Strikes Back.”', 'While the Fyllingsdalstunnelen is pitching itself as the world’s longest purpose-built cycle tunnel, the reason for that caveat is the 3.6-kilometer-long Snoqualmie Tunnel in Washington, just east of Seattle. This former train tunnel is now a passageway for cyclists, runners and walkers and is part of the 250-mile Palouse to Cascades State Park Trail.', 'Six European cities made it in CNN Travel’s recent roundup of 10 of the world’s most bike-friendly cities. Copenhagen has 385 kilometers of bike lanes, having introduced its first one way back in 1892. Strasbourg in France has around 6,000 bikes available at self-service stations 24/7 which tourists can use.

There’s no end to sex scenes and other steamy content featuring the young and unwrinkled, but past a certain age, popular culture largely draws a blank — or treats sex as a punchline.', 'Last year, the artist Marilyn Minter set out to change that, gathering a group of men and women aged 70 and older in her New York studio to showcase a lesser-seen side of sex and relationships. In erotic and colorful images, the seniors are stripped down to lingerie or briefs; they hug, kiss and caress each other in the heat of the moment. The photographs beckon our attention to challenge something still seen as taboo, showing playful, loving moments of pleasure.', 'Cold, remote and short of women: A portrait of life on the Faroe Islands', '“There’s so much contempt for elder sex. Even one of the models that I worked with said, ‘Who wants to see all these?’” Minter recalled in a video call with CNN.', '“My whole thought process going into it was that we’re pioneers,” she continued of the unabashedly sexualized context. “Nobody’s ever shot elder people affectionately, and with any kind of elegance. And that was my goal — to make to make them look very desirable.”', 'A handful of the ensuing images were originally published in the New York Times Magazine, accompanying a candid editorial feature about seniors’ sex lives. Minter is now publishing the series in full in the forthcoming book “Elder Sex,” and exhibiting them at New York gallery LGDR. The exhibition, which opened in April, is her first solo show in the city since the Brooklyn Museum mounted her retrospective “Pretty/Dirty” in 2016, and features highlights from her five-decade-long career, as well as other new bodies of work.', 'In “Elder Sex,” Minter utilized one of her signature aesthetics, which she has explored in both hyperrealistic paintings and photographs: jewel-toned, close-cropped compositions of glistening bodies, seemingly shown through the glass of a steamed-up mirror or window. But despite her credentials as one of the most important and boundary-breaking artists today — and despite stars such as Lady Gaga and Lizzo posing for her — Minter couldn’t find enough real couples willing to participate.', '“We wanted to (include) all races, all types of sex,” Minter explained. “We had a lot of trouble getting models. I’m 74. I asked all my friends — in mixed-race relationships, in lesbian relationships — and none of them would do it.”', 'In the end, Minter cast actors along with the few people who had agreed. She paired them together in her studio, photographing them behind a panel of frozen glass — a trick to achieve the steamy, wet look without battling the ephemerality of water vapor. During their shoots, Minter said all her models, who were as old as 89 years old, told her they still had regular, enjoyable sex lives. Their sentiments matched the people interviewed for the New York Times Magazine article, who described deepening intimacy with their partners later in life, as well as learning to navigate and appreciate their needs as their bodies aged.', 'Minter believes there’s a sense of freedom in sex later in life that, for many people, can take time to reach.', '“When you’re young and having sex, it’s a little more performative than it is when you’re 80,” she said. As an older person, “You’re thinking, ‘This is me. Take it or leave it. I’m just going to enjoy myself. I’m not going to fake anything here.’”', ""'The Ugly Duchess:' How an unsettling Renaissance portrait challenges ideas of aging women and beauty"", 'Minter acknowledges that sex and self-image is fraught for women of all ages — older women are rarely seen or taken seriously as having intimate needs, while for younger women, sexual agency is often a tightrope walk — too much of it and you can be “excoriated and slut-shamed,” Minter said.', '“When you’re 25, there’s just so much fear about young women owning sexual agency — it’s just terrifying to people,” she said.', 'But the artist sees some progress in who gets to be seen as desirable on our television screens, reflecting a burgeoning broader shift in cultural attitudes around sex. She pointed to photographs in People magazine comparing the characters of  “The Golden Girls” and “Sex and the City,” who are the same age at the time of the latter’s reboot on HBO Max (which is owned by CNN’s parent company, Warner Bros. Discovery). “The 50s look a lot different in the 2020s!” a caption exclaimed.', 'Though “The Golden Girls” also delved into romance and intimacy — and was widely-viewed as remarkably sex-positive for its time — there’s a stark contrast in how women in their 50s are presented across the two shows.', '“I thought, ‘Okay, here’s why it’s different,” she said. “Number one: People live a lot longer, and they’re healthier… Number two: there’s this thing called Viagra.” Minter laughed, adding: “But who retired at 54? To a home in Florida with three other ladies? What?”', 'She hopes “Elder Sex” will not only serve as a much-needed visual reference for what intimacy can look like at older ages, but will also resonate for people who feel like their desires — and lives — are overlooked.', '“It gives permission to people who feel shame about their sexual urges,” she said. “I want this to give them permission to explore that and erase the shame.”', '“Elder Sex,” published by JBE Books, is available now.', '© 2024 Cable News Network.

In its World Economic Outlook released last week, the International Monetary Fund said China is “rebounding strongly” following the reopening of its economy. The country’s GDP will grow 5.2% this year and 5.1% in 2024, it predicted.', 'However, some analysts believe the strong growth reported in the first quarter was the product of “backloading” of economic activity from the fourth quarter of 2022, which was weighed down by pandemic restrictions and then a chaotic reopening.', '“Our core view is that China’s economy is deflationary,” said Raymond Yeung, chief economist for Greater China at ANZ Research, in a Tuesday research report.', 'If adjustments are made to account for the impact of delayed economic activity, GDP growth in the first quarter could have been just 2.6%, he said.', 'Some key data released on Tuesday support this idea. For example, private investment was extremely weak.', 'Fixed asset investment by the private sector increased a mere 0.6% from January to March, indicating a lack of confidence among entrepreneurs. (State-led investment, meanwhile, advanced 10%.) That’s even worse than the 0.8% growth recorded in the January-to-February period.', 'The Chinese government has resorted to surprising measures to restore confidence among private entrepreneurs, but the campaign has inspired more nervousness than optimism.', ""China resorts to unusual measures to restore confidence among entrepreneurs.

Jones is co-author of “Say it Loud: An Illustrated History of the Black Athlete.” She talks politics, sports and culture weekly on Philadelphia’s 900AM WURD. The views expressed here are solely hers. Read more opinion on CNN.', 'The ruling earlier this month by a Texas federal judge to suspend the US Food and Drug Administration’s approval of a drug that is used frequently for medication abortions, is very personal for me.', 'That’s because I took mifepristone years ago during a miscarriage, and it saved my life.', 'When I was prescribed mifepristone, it had not yet taken center stage in America’s abortion wars. I did not have to make a rushed road trip across state lines to get my medicine, unlike many women who need the drug but live in one of the many states that have restricted access to medication abortion or passed near-total bans on abortion.', 'I was not forced to set up a secret meet-up with a stranger in order to buy my medicine on the black market, as several women I spoke to recently said they planned to do. Nor did I have to order mifepristone online and find myself navigating the many scammers taking advantage of the current patchwork of state abortion laws in the US.', 'Opinion: Anti-abortion advocates are using junk science to usurp the will of the American people', 'Mifepristone is one of two drugs used in a medication abortion and the other, misoprostol, was not subject to the ruling by the Texas judge. The two drugs can be administered to someone having a miscarriage, allowing them to terminate the pregnancy when the fetus is not viable.', 'It happened some years ago: After experiencing more than a day of hemorrhaging during the first trimester of my pregnancy, I visited my ob-gyn, who explained after examining me that my blood pressure was dropping rapidly and the heavy bleeding I was experiencing was an unmistakable sign of a miscarriage.', 'For many women, being prescribed mifepristone is part of their routine medical care. Not so in my case: As my doctor explained, I was facing a dire medical emergency. I was grateful for the medication that saved my life.', 'My miscarriage took me by surprise. I had loved being pregnant the first time around, about a decade earlier. And as a healthy woman, I had no reason for fear when I became pregnant again. By the time I was administered mifepristone, I was losing a life that I had already begun to love. And like many other women, despite my level of education or economic status, I could not outrun the statistics that put Black women at higher risk.', 'Up to one in four known pregnancies will end in a miscarriage. And for Black women, the numbers are alarmingly higher. According to an analysis of 4.6 million pregnancies in seven countries, the risk of a miscarriage for Black women is 43% higher than for White women.', ""Opinion: Texas judge's stunning ruling caps extraordinary week"", 'In the Black community, women have traditionally been taught to bear their burdens silently — keep your business to yourself — even after something as devastating as pregnancy loss. We are conditioned to do as I did back then, and keep it moving as we try to outrun the long list of statistics that tell us our lives are in danger from every direction, whether it be from health care risks to societal injustices or other stressors.', 'During my miscarriage, I was a woman who was afraid, hemorrhaging and in excruciating pain, in desperate need of safe, emergency medical care. Thanks to the administration of mifepristone, I was allowed dignity during my miscarriage. It’s what every woman deserves — whether it be facing a potentially life-threatening miscarriage or seeking an abortion.', 'I learned from my experience that every miscarriage matters. Women must have access to whatever medicines and counseling we need to help us heal and that includes mifepristone. What we don’t need is to be criminalized by politicians and punitive reproductive laws that have long been out of step with public opinion. Despite the continuing political attacks on women’s reproductive rights, more than 61% of US adults say abortion should be legal in all or most cases, according to Pew Research Center.', 'After the US Justice Department asked the Supreme Court to intervene, Justice Samuel Alito issued a temporary order to preserve the status quo, ensuring access to the drug while giving the justices more time to study the issue.', 'I am hoping the justices can put politics aside and focus on the science surrounding the safety of mifepristone, a drug that, thankfully, I had access to when my life was in danger. Mifepristone, a synthetic steroid, is even safer than common prescription drugs including penicillin and Viagra.', 'Following the science demands that, regardless of where you stand on the issue of abortion, consideration must be made for cases like mine and the millions of other women who for years have safely used this medication for complications surrounding miscarriages.', '• Sign up for CNN Opinion’s newsletter.• Join us on Twitter and Facebook', 'We do not know how the legal fight over medication abortion will unfold. But women across the nation – in blue and red states alike  – are watching. Punitive laws like the one signed last week by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis seek to criminalize reproductive care providers. And worse, they are stripping us of rights that men take for granted – it’s unlikely they will be prohibited by the law from making health care decisions about their own bodies.', 'It must end.

He was the Democratic vice presidential nominee in the 2000 presidential election. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN.', 'When Ralph Nader ran for president in 2000, he offered a simple rationale for a bid that would ultimately help “spoil” the election for the Democratic ticket I was privileged to be on with Al Gore. In Nader’s view, the two parties were ideologically indistinguishable.', 'That argument was baseless. There were significant differences in policy between the George W. Bush-Dick Cheney ticket — which ended up victorious, in part thanks to Nader — and ours. For Nader, this wasn’t really about the “two-party duopoly,” as he coined it. This was about his desire to push Gore and the Democratic Party to the left.', 'Today, of course, no one can reasonably argue that the two parties aren’t ideologically distinct. The core problem in Washington, DC, is that they’re too divided to get much done.', 'Though a majority of Americans long for the era when Republicans and Democrats worked together to find bipartisan solutions to big problems, many members of Congress refuse to work together on immigration, the debt ceiling and other issues critical to the nation, even when bipartisanship is the way to restore our common prosperity and security.\xa0Indeed, today, with Republicans controlling the House and Democrats the Senate, bipartisanship is the only way to pass any legislation.', 'While undoing the divisions plaguing our political system will not be simple, there is one step that can be taken — and it begins with giving voters a real alternative in the 2024 presidential election.', 'Most often, when Americans cast their votes for president and vice president, their ballot has only two viable tickets: one nominated by the Democratic Party and the other by the Republican Party. But what would happen if they had a third viable option?', 'The process for adding that third viable option is not only arduous and time-consuming, but it varies from state to state and in the District of Columbia.', 'Opinion: Don’t count DeSantis out yet; the GOP’s 2024 race is far from over', 'Today, No Labels, a nonprofit organization that I co-chair, is laying the groundwork for such a campaign in 2024. Since early 2022, our team has been diligently working across the country to obtain ballot access for a potential No Labels ticket, typically by collecting a certain number of petition signatures from voters in each state.', 'If we are successful, a unity ticket — comprised of one Democrat and one Republican — could be presented to voters right next to the Republican and Democratic nominees.', 'We think of this as an insurance policy for the country — an option to be deployed if, and only if, both of the two major party nominees fail to offer voters a choice of candidates they’d like to vote for or a way out of the partisan divisiveness that now dominates in the nation’s capital. We will be consistently monitoring the sentiment of Americans through our own research and polling, as well as public polling, to make that determination.', 'In this and several other ways, No Labels’ effort could not be more different from the “spoiler” campaign that Nader attempted two decades ago.', 'First, if No Labels were to lend its ballot lines to a presidential ticket, the presidential candidate would be a Democrat and the vice presidential candidate would be a Republican, or vice versa. As such, it would appeal to some voters who might otherwise have voted for the Democratic ticket, and other voters who might otherwise have voted for the Republican ticket. And it would appeal to still other voters who would not have voted for either.', 'Opinion: Why Biden is lying low ahead of 2024', 'These nominees would be selected by a diverse and distinguished group of citizens serving on a committee — and would be ratified by delegates who would gather at the No Labels National Convention planned for April 2024. This convention will occur about six weeks after the March 5th “Super Tuesday” primaries, a day which historically has clarified who the major party nominees will be.', 'Second, No Labels’ 2024 effort is not designed to push the Democratic nominees to the left or Republican candidates to the right. Rather, it’s intended to force one or both parties to appeal to America’s growing commonsense majority. If they don’t, our ballot line will create the opening for a unity ticket that will.', 'According to\xa0recent polling by CNN, the number of individuals who identify as independent is on the rise, now comprising 41% of the electorate — compared to only 28% who described themselves as Democrats and 31% who described themselves as Republicans. These numbers are more evidence that there could be a potential path to victory for an independent ticket in 2024.', 'But if there doesn’t appear to be such a path in the months ahead, No Labels will stand down, focusing instead on the work we have done over the last decade to elect and organize members of the House and Senate who have demonstrated the courage to reach across the aisle — including members of the bipartisan House Problem Solvers Caucus.', '', 'It seems the Biden administration already may be beginning to recognize the imperative of appealing to the commonsense majority. President Joe Biden recently signed into law a Republican measure to strike down a Washington, DC, crime bill reducing penalties for those who commit violent crimes, and he announced more stringent border control policies.', 'Our hope is that the Republicans jockeying for their party’s nomination will similarly see the need to reach out beyond their base instead of appealing to divisive policies and politics.', 'In the end, No Labels hopes not to have to offer our ballot line to an independent unity ticket. We want the parties to come to their senses. But judging from the angry and apocalyptic reactions of strategists in both parties at the thought of No Labels’ insurance policy, it is clear that party leaders now know that there could be a political cost to ignoring the commonsense majority.

Jim Jordan — is set to hold a field hearing in New York City called “Victims of Violent Crime in Manhattan.” A statement bills the hearing as an examination of how, the Judiciary Committee says, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s policies have “led to an increase in violent crime and a dangerous community for New York City residents.”', 'In response, Bragg’s office slammed Jordan’s hearing as “a political stunt” while noting that data released by the New York Police Department shows crime is down in Manhattan with respect to murders, burglaries, robberies and more through April 2, compared with the same period last year.', 'In reality, this Jordan-led hearing isn’t about stopping crime but about defending Trump — who was recently charged by a Manhattan grand jury with 34 felonies. Trump pleaded not guilty to the criminal charges stemming from an investigation into a hush-money payment to an adult film actress. The former president also is facing criminal probes in other jurisdictions over efforts to overturn the 2020 election and his handling of classified documents at Mar-a-Lago.', 'Bragg sued Jordan and his committee last week in federal court, accusing the Judiciary Committee chairman of a “transparent campaign to intimidate and attack” his office for its investigation and prosecution of Trump by making demands for confidential documents and testimony.', 'While Jordan and his committee appear focused on discrediting the investigation into Trump, why aren’t they looking into two recent bombshell reports by ProPublica that raised red flags about Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas’ financial relationship with GOP megadonor Harlan Crow? After all, the House Judiciary Committee’s website explains that it has jurisdiction over “matters relating to the administration of justice in federal courts” – for which the revelations concerning Thomas fit perfectly.', ""The Clarence Thomas revelations are the last straw. It's time for Congress to act"", 'First, we learned in early April that Crow had provided Thomas and his wife, Ginni, for decades with luxurious vacations including on the donor’s yacht and private jet to faraway places such as Indonesia and New Zealand. That information was never revealed to the public. (In a rare public statement, Thomas responded he was advised at the time that he did not have to report the trips. The justice said the guidelines for reporting personal hospitality have changed recently. “And, it is, of course, my intent to follow this guidance in the future,” he said.)', 'Then on Thursday, ProPublica reported that Thomas failed to disclose a 2014 real estate deal involving the sale of three properties he and his family owned in Savannah, Georgia, to that same GOP megadonor, Crow. One of Crow’s companies made the purchases for $133,363, according to ProPublica. A federal disclosure law passed after Watergate requires Supreme Court justices and other officials to make public the details of most real estate sales over $1,000.', 'As ProPublica detailed, the federal disclosure form Thomas filed for that year included a space to report the identity of the buyer in any private transaction, but Thomas left that space blank. Four ethics law experts told ProPublica that Thomas’ failure to report it appears to be a violation of the law. (Thomas did not respond to questions from ProPublica on its report; CNN reached out to the Supreme Court and Thomas for comment.)', 'Thomas revelation of gifts fits a broader pattern of financial nondisclosure from the Supreme Court', 'The House Judiciary Committee has long addressed issues such as those surrounding Thomas. In fact, the committee is where investigations and the impeachment of federal judges often commence.', 'One recent example came in 2010 with Judge G. Thomas Porteous Jr., whom the committee investigated and recommended for impeachment.', 'The committee’s Task Force on Judicial Impeachment said evidence showed Porteous “intentionally made material false statements and representations under penalty of perjury, engaged in a corrupt kickback scheme, solicited and accepted unlawful gifts, and intentionally misled the Senate during his confirmation proceedings.” The Senate later found Porteous guilty of four articles of impeachment and removed him from the bench.', 'Yet the Judiciary Committee has neither released statements nor tweets raising alarm bells about Thomas. Instead, its Twitter feed is filled with repeated tweets whining that C-SPAN won’t cover Monday’s New York field hearing. Worse, the committee retweeted GOP Rep. Mary Miller’s tweet defending Thomas as being attacked “because he is a man of deep faith, who loves our country and believes in our Constitution.”', 'Jordan’s use of his committee to assist Trump should surprise no one. The House January 6 committee’s report called the Ohio Republican “a significant player in President Trump’s efforts” to overturn the election. The report detailed the lawmaker’s efforts to assist Trump including on “January 2, 2021, Representative Jordan led a conference call in which he, President Trump, and other Members of Congress discussed strategies for delaying the January 6th joint session.” As a result, the January 6 committee subpoenaed Jordan to testify — but he refused to cooperate.', 'Sign up for CNN Opinion’s newsletter.Join us on Twitter and Facebook', 'In contrast with the House panel, the Senate Judiciary Committee — headed by Democrats — announced in the wake of the reporting on Thomas that it plans to hold a hearing “on the need to restore confidence in the Supreme Court’s ethical standards.” Beyond that, Democratic Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island and Rep. Hank Johnson of Georgia sent a letter Friday calling for a referral of Thomas to the US attorney general over “potential violations of the Ethics in Government Act 1978.”', 'The House Judiciary Committee’s website notes, “The Committee on the Judiciary has been called the lawyer for the House of Representatives.” Under Jordan that description needs to be updated to state that the Committee on the Judiciary is now “the lawyer for Donald J. Trump.” And the worst part is that the taxpayers are the ones paying for Jordan’s work on Trump’s behalf.', '© 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

When it became public, the Zimmerman Telegram caused a sensation, helping propel the US into the conflict against Germany.', '“Never before or since has so much turned upon the solution of a secret message,” wrote David Kahn in his classic 1967 history of secret communications, “The Codebreakers.” The Germans had taken great pains to keep their intentions confidential, and the codebreakers in London’s “Room 40” had to do a lot of work to decipher the telegram.', 'Their efforts stand in stark contrast to the ease with which secrets came tumbling out of a Pentagon intelligence network when 21-year-old Massachusetts Air National Guard cyber specialist Jack Teixeira allegedly posted hundreds of documents on a Discord chatroom known as “Thug Shaker Central.” The disclosures likely won’t start a war, but they could prove extremely damaging to the US and several of its allies, including Ukraine.', 'Teixeira is one of more than one million people who have Top Secret clearance. “The Pentagon has already started taking steps to limit the number of people who have access to such sensitive information,” wrote Brett Bruen, a former US diplomat and Obama administration official. “But much more can be done. … Why do so many people, especially those working short stints in government, have access to information that can shape the fate of nations and their leaders?”', 'Writing in the Financial Times, Kori Schake saw “some good news.”', '“While specific details will be incredibly valuable to Russia and other adversaries, these are not bombshell revelations: journalists had already reported Ukrainian ammunition running low; peace talks between Moscow and Kyiv were never likely; allies have long been aware that the US eavesdrops on them; and the disparaging assessment of Ukraine’s forthcoming offensive may prove no more accurate than previous predictions were.” These will not prove as damaging as the Edward Snowden and Chelsea Manning disclosures.', 'But, she warned, “Technology making data ever more portable, distribution more global and communications more bespoke will make it easier to amass information and distribute it — either privately or publicly.”', 'In less than a week, the two Democrats expelled from the Tennessee House for their participation in a gun control protest were sent back to office by local officials.', 'Writing for CNN Opinion, Rep. Justin Pearson noted, “This should be a chastening moment for revanchist forces in Tennessee’s legislature and across the country. Over the long haul, the undemocratic machinations employed to oust us from office are destined to fail. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. once famously said that the moral arc of the universe bends toward justice. Events this week demonstrated, more than ever, that this is indeed the case…”', '“Over two-thirds of Americans — including four out of 10 Republicans — support the kind of common sense gun safety laws that Rep.

The NRA’s internal struggles have weakened its influence while Democrats in office, who once feared touching the issue of guns, are increasingly speaking out. And they are making some progress in enacting new state laws, Burns noted.', '“The American people decisively support Democratic proposals for addressing the scourge of gun violence. Political watchers who criticized Democrats for talking too much about abortion during the 2022 midterm elections later ate crow after that once-dreaded culture war topic topped the list of voter concerns nationally…', '“Biden and the Democrats have the rare opportunity to build yet another winning coalition out of an issue once viewed as political poison.”', 'On Friday, the Supreme Court issued an order that temporarily ensured access to a key drug used in many medication abortions. The move gave the justices more time to consider the issue after a Texas federal judge suspended the US Food and Drug Administration’s approval of the abortion pill 23 years ago.', '“If abortion opponents are successful, access to the pill — reportedly used in more than half of abortions in the United States — will be severely undercut,” wrote Michele Goodwin and Mary Ziegler.', '“Beyond the dangerous precedent this sets for challenges to other important FDA-approved drugs that some political factions don’t like, the case is an alarming expression of the way right-wing activists are using junk science to bypass the will of the American public and restrict abortion…”', '“There are no grounds for challenging mifepristone’s approval, especially 23 years after the fact. The drug received extensive review — more than four years — before FDA approval. Moreover, claims that mifepristone threatens the health of those who take it are unfounded. The drug has a better safety record for use than Viagra and penicillin. Notably, it was available and used for years without incident in Europe.”', 'In 1986, Nicholas Daniloff, the Moscow bureau chief for US News & World Report, was seized by Soviet authorities and locked up in Lefortovo prison.

Gershkovich has been charged with espionage but US officials have concluded that he was “wrongfully detained.”', 'As David A. Andelman noted, Daniloff’s detention in prison lasted for 13 days before he was put under house arrest and then eventually swapped for an accused Soviet spy. In a conversation with Andelman, Daniloff recalled his reaction when he was imprisoned. “I felt claustrophobic, and I felt like I wanted to get out of there immediately. Of course, there was no chance of that. The door slams, and you have all these thoughts and feelings that run through you, and then you settle down and you realize you’re going to be hanging around that cell for some time.”', 'Gershkovich’s family in Philadelphia received a letter, handwritten in Russian, from the reporter Friday.', '“I want to say that I am not losing hope,” he noted. “I read.

The moments of peace and joy are as vital as the moments of violence. In fact, it’s the periods of peace, of success, of interfaith community, that reveal the terrible truth about the violence: it wasn’t inevitable. People could have made different choices…”', '“A show like ‘The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel’ lets me revel in my personal New York Jewish heritage while also getting a little break from all the worry. It’s a warm, funny, sexy, extremely Jewish …. comedy that hits me straight in my glossy childhood memories. That isn’t to say the show isn’t also problematic — it most certainly is.”', 'In the latest installment of CNN Opinion’s “Little Kids, Big Questions” series, 10-year-old Ronan wonders if animals are capable of being smarter than humans. With the help of the John Templeton Foundation, which is partnering on the project, the answer came from Jane Goodall, world renowned for her work with chimpanzees.', '“One of the attributes of intelligence is the ability to think and solve problems. In the early 1960s, I was told that this was unique to humans, and only we could use and make tools, only we had language and culture,” Goodall said. “But more and more research has proved that many animals are excellent at solving problems. Many use tools, and many show cultural differences. Some scientists believe that whales and dolphins are communicating with what may be a real language.”', '“Although the difference between humans and other animals is simply one of degree, our intellect really is amazing. …bees can count and do math, and that just shows how much we still have to learn about animal intelligence. But humans can calculate the distance to the stars.”', 'Earlier this month, a Texas jury convicted Daniel Perry of murder for fatally shooting a Black Lives Matter protester in 2020. The jury deliberated for 17 hours and decided Perry’s action couldn’t be excused under the state’s “stand your ground” law.

Read more opinion at CNN.', 'Four years ago, almost to the day, the people of Sudan were celebrating a revolution after overthrowing longtime dictator Omar al-Bashir. Now the East African country faces the possibility of a complete collapse similar to the chaos we see today in Yemen or Libya.', 'On Saturday, rival military factions began fighting each other in the capital of Khartoum. The two sides battled for control of the nation’s airports, bases and military compounds. Violence quickly spilled into the streets and across the country.', 'Some 45 million Sudanese effectively are held hostage and are unable to venture out of their homes for fear of being killed in the crossfire. At least 180 people have perished in the fighting, including three World Food Programme humanitarian workers.', 'The conflict pits two bitter rivals and their powerful armed forces against each other. On one side are the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), led by Gen. Abdel Fattah al-Burhan. On the other side are the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), a paramilitary group led by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, known as Hemeti.', 'There is no good side in this conflict. Both have been accused of a long litany of human rights violations.', 'How did Sudan go from casting off despotic rule and creating a fledgling democracy a few years ago to teetering on the brink of state collapse?', 'On April 11, 2019, Sudan’s longtime dictator, Bashir, was overthrown. The cause of Bashir’s removal was months of protests led by Sudan’s unions, which spurred a military coup from the SAF and RSF. Both Burhan and Hemeti joined forces to remove their former boss.', ""Rival generals battle for control in Sudan. Here's a guide to the fighting"", 'It was a moment of promise because there was hope for democracy. I remember walking around the “sit-in” — a giant carnival of freedom in the middle of Khartoum that protesters had blocked off to demand change. It was electric.', 'But social movements such as the Sudanese Professionals Association (SPA) — the union behind the protest — often struggle to translate the momentum of their demonstrations into real political power.', 'The reason for this is, in part, structural. Social movements such as the SPA are often based on grassroots activism. A dictator can arrest one or two leaders of an organization but not an entire country.', 'However, once a dictator is overthrown, these kinds of social movements often struggle to build the leadership hierarchy necessary during political negotiations that take place. Like many other movements, Sudan’s protesters were unable to translate mobilization into political power.', 'After a lifetime spent in war zones, this is what stays with me above all else', 'Civilian leaders entered into a negotiation with the military over the future of the country shortly after Bashir fell in April 2019. The two sides were not evenly matched. Because of these leadership challenges, the pro-democracy forces struggled to bargain with the disciplined military.', 'Any momentum that pro-democracy advocates had during the negotiations was stamped out in June 2019 when RSF soldiers violently dispersed the sit-in. More than 100 people were killed.', 'After the June massacre and the leadership challenges, a transitional constitution was signed in August 2019 that gave the SAF and RSF most of the power in Sudan. Burhan was the head of state, and Hemeti was placed in an elevated political position. Elections were promised in 2022, but few believed they would actually happen.', 'The transitional period began in August 2019, and I interviewed Abdalla Hamdok, the civilian prime minister, several times for a book that I co-wrote on Sudan’s revolution. The way that the constitution was written meant that Hamdok had limited power as the prime minister. Burhan was the head of state and wanted to preserve the powers of the SAF.', 'Hamdok often told me that revolutions come in cycles. The 2019 removal of Bashir was a high point of revolution, and he saw his job as making as many reforms as possible before the low tide of counterrevolution swept him away.', 'Hamdok found that the legacy of 30 years of dictatorship meant that Sudan’s political and economic models were dilapidated. But Burhan and Hemeti blocked the big reforms that Hamdok wanted to make.', ""Darfur's return to war would spell disaster for Sudan"", 'Outside Khartoum violence grew. Parts of Sudan such as Darfur saw a new round of conflict between ethnic groups orchestrated by RSF troops. More than 430,000 people were displaced due to conflict in Sudan, mostly in Darfur.', 'Soldiers did not hide the atrocities they committed against civilians. I remember drinking tea with a soldier aligned with the RSF at his house in Darfur as he explained why he had recently participated in the burning down of a village from another ethnic group.', 'The soldier reasoned that a member of his tribe had been killed in an altercation, so the RSF-aligned forces took revenge by torching a village that had been home to 30,000 people. At least 163 people died.', 'Tensions between the SAF and RSF grew. Burhan viewed Hemeti and his RSF forces as upstart usurpers from Darfur who were undisciplined. Hemeti on the other hand believed that it was time for Darfur to lead Sudan.', 'Hamdok was on the cusp of beginning to turn the economy around when Burhan and the SAF intervened. As we wrote in the book “Sudan’s Unfinished Democracy,” the potential success of a civilian government was too much for Burhan. In October 2021, Hamdok was removed in a military coup.', 'After the October 2021 coup, the United States and United Nations pushed a worse version of the transitional constitution in Sudan. They argued that it was the best way to bring democracy.', 'The idea was to restart the transitional period, but I and many others argued it was shortsighted and wouldn’t work. Returning to a government led by Burhan was clearly not going to usher in democracy. If the plan ended in a coup the first time, why would it work the second time?', ""How the battle for Bakhmut exposed Russia's 'meat-grinder'"", 'Some activists stopped partnering with the US and came to see the UN mission as a roadblock to democracy because of these policies. I felt sorry when I spoke with the best American and foreign diplomats, who also understood the international policy in Sudan wouldn’t work. They saw the flaws but felt powerless to dissent and were forced to carry out decisions made many levels above them.', 'What preceded this weekend’s outbreak of clashes was a controversial part of the international policy that tried to unify the SAF and RSF. The idea was to make a single army, but neither Hemeti nor Burhan wanted to give up the power they had amassed.', 'The plan to unify the military hadn’t worked in similar contexts. It was a repeat of the 2013 and 2016 unification processes that took place in South Sudan with similarly bloody results. Instead, the tenuous relationship between Burhan and Hemeti boiled over due to the pressure.', 'It can be easy to look at the recent history of “revolutions” in countries such as Myanmar, Tunisia, Egypt and Sudan and conclude that they eventually backfire. I don’t agree. I learned from Sudanese activists that a nation’s political fortune is an active battle.', 'Sign up for CNN Opinion’s newsletter.Join us on Twitter and Facebook', 'We can one day hope that Sudan sees dreams of democracy come true.

And the fourth hour also marked the return of Logan’s wife, Marcia (Hiam Abbass), in what felt like “Marcia Strikes Back,” while his current and much younger girlfriend, Kerri (Zoe Winter), was bluntly shown the door. (The latter evoked memories of the musical “Evita,” when the title character boots Peron’s mistress, who sings about another suitcase in another hall.)', 'More than anything, the episode underscored just how brutally funny “Succession” can be, with Shiv (Sarah Snook) reading her father’s obituary and musing, “Dad sounds amazing. I would like to have met dad,” while brothers Kendall (Jeremy Strong) and Roman (Kieran Culkin) hilariously translated the language, with references to Logan having been “a man of his time” equaling “racist.”', 'The episode also showcased the executives at Waystar Royco, who uncomfortably wondered what to do with a document that included not only Logan’s posthumous wishes but hand-written notes that seemingly specified who he wished to succeed him. They joked, feebly, about tossing the paper in the toilet, while making very clear how much they really wanted to toss the paper in the toilet.', 'All the knives came out, with Carl (David Rasche) brutally insulting Tom (Matthew Macfadyen), scarcely hiding behind the fact that he was presenting the doubts about Tom’s future as a hypothetical.', 'Amid that, though, there were also human moments, with the tortured Kendall articulating his conflicted feelings to Waystar executive Frank (Peter Friedman) by saying, “He made me hate him, and he died. I feel like he didn’t like me. I disappointed him.”', '“Succession” also underscored the fragility of not just life, but a corporate legacy, with the public-relations folk discussing how to spin and diminish Logan’s involvement in his later years as a means of bucking up the company and its stock price – a maneuver that Kendall ultimately and surreptitiously approved, concluding that it was the sort of smart and ruthless move that his father would have executed.', 'Questions of succession also appear to be threatening the harmony achieved by Kendall, Shiv and Roman prior to Logan’s exit, with Shiv being left as the odd woman out in a plan to fill the CEO seat just long enough to close the sale to GoJo. Trust doesn’t come easily in series creator Jesse Armstrong’s world, and when Shiv said, “I need to wet my beak,” the assurances from her brothers clearly left the impression how easily that beak could wind up bent out of joint.', 'Ultimately, after the operating highs of the previous episode, the series successfully turned the page from grieving to the next order of business. And that too, as Kendall put it regarding Logan and the “bad dad” PR leaks, is “what he would do.”', '© 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

Just look at the plethora of AI girlfriend bots that quickly flooded OpenAI’s GPT store after it launched earlier this month—even though they seemed to violate the new store’s rules.', 'The trend shouldn’t be surprising. More and more of our person-to-person relationships, especially for younger generations, are digitally mediated via apps and screens. That has enabled relationship bots to be a natural fit.', 'But the new virtual romantic partners might be more of a novelty than a new normal.', '“I don’t think that we’re going to lose personal relationships to chatbot relationships,” said Laura Nelson, a University of British Columbia sociology professor.', 'Relationship chatbots, she said, fill a niche role—and likely will stay that way.', 'Relationship  chatbots have been around for more than a decade. In 2014, Microsoft released its chatbot Xiaoice, which became a viral hit in China and was regarded by many as a virtual girlfriend. But AI girlfriend chatbots didn’t take off in the US then, so Nelson is skeptical that girlfriend or boyfriend chatbots will boom here any time soon.', 'Relationship chatbots are more likely going to be marketed toward men,  Nelson said.', 'Historically, there’s always a small section of the population in which more men than women are seeking sexual and emotional connection through means like sex texting and online forums, Nelson said. And that will continue in the AI market, she said, where there’s money to be made.', 'Nelson said “female” AI chatbots are more common than “male” AI chatbots largely for social reasons. Because of societal pressure, men are not as good at creating emotional bonds with other men for friendship, she said — and girlfriend chatbots can fulfill needs that many men aren’t receiving from male friends.', 'For women, there’s more of a stigma around interacting with a chatbot, so they’re less likely to be public about dating\xa0a chatbot, Nelson added. Meanwhile, relationships between men and AI have become more normalized through pop culture, Nelson said. Perhaps the most high-profile example is the only somewhat futuristic 2013 movie Her, in which Joaquin Phoenix develops a relationship with an AI virtual assistant voiced by Scarlett Johansson.', 'In China, Microsoft’s Xiaoice has become integrated into the social fabric, in some cases serving as  emotional support for aging parents, Nelson said. China also has stricter policies around what technology can or cannot do.', 'The real concern, Nelson said, is what guardrails are built around chatbots when a user pours sensitive information into the chatbot.', 'Either way, with the Microsofts and OpenAIs of the world releasing a slew of chatbots for people to interact with daily, it’s clear that they’re sticking around. The only question is what other forms chatbots will take.', 'Nelson speculated that chatbots for work assistance, such as writing emails or caring for the elderly, are likely in our future. A 2019 study, for instance, found that using non-speaking, plush pet-like robots with older adults living with dementia had the potential to improve their quality of life, social interaction, and loneliness, among other things.', 'As with any tech hype cycle, once the noise dies down, the real use cases will emerge.', 'Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.', '']"

The brand was confident this equipment upgrade would lead to better quality sandwiches that would entice more customers.', '“We were one of the few, if only, sub shop that didn’t slice in restaurant,” Subway CEO John Chidsey told CNN at the time of the announcement. “Not only does it give the guest a better perception of seeing the nice, fluffy meat, but we save a lot of money since we were paying a lot of money to have it sliced upstream.”', 'The upgraded sandwiches have not appeared to make the splash that Chidsey was hoping they would, at least not according to franchisees.', '“We haven’t seen any data that says these slicers have driven sales, driven customer counts or profitability,” Bill Mathis, a Minnesota Subway franchisee, told Restaurant Business on a recent podcast episode.', 'To showcase the capabilities of the new equipment, Subway released a lineup of offerings called Deli Heroes that even featured extra meat to show off the prowess of the slicers. The Takeout conducted its own taste test of the sandwiches made with freshly sliced meat and found them to be nothing short of ordinary. In fact, we’d be hard pressed to say there was any detectable difference between the pre-sliced meats and the new in-restaurant cuts.', 'The Washington Post also reviewed the Deli Heroes and found new meats to be hit or miss, virtually indiscernible from the pre-sliced meats previously offered at Subway. The slicers don’t alter the customer experience in any notable way, but instead serve as a way for the brand to catch up to what others in the industry are already doing.', 'Subway has stated some franchisees told the company the slicers are easy to use, and that the machines streamline the labor previously needed to prepare the meats; the company expects franchisees will see long-term savings because the more costly pre-sliced meat won’t need to be ordered anymore. The company also notes the equipment was added to restaurants at no cost to the franchisees.', 'However, Mathis, the Minnesota franchisee, argues the slicers cause more food waste, since you can’t slice all the way to the ends of the meat. He also notes that the slicing results in more work put upon employees, and in trying to slice enough for rush periods, some meats might sit out too long and have to be discarded.', '“Sometimes we have to slice so much at a time, lower volume stores may have to throw away product before the shelf life is up, which we encourage everybody to do because we want to serve the best product available,” Mathis told Restaurant Business.', 'Subway workers on Reddit have echoed these sentiments. Some point out that cleaning the slicer equipment leads to even more work than before.', '“IMO as a franchisee since 2008, it’s a stupid waste of time that isn’t saving me any money, but does take up my employees time like no other,” commented one Reddit user in a thread about the slicers. “Also I take my sweet time cleaning the shit out of that slicer everyday to avoid bacteria build up, but based on what I know about this brands quality standards, I’d bet a lot of slicers aren’t as clean as they should be.”', 'Subway has noted the slicers are still very new to its restaurants’ operations.

But if you live outside of the Indian diaspora, you may not have ever heard of the Baadshah of Bollywood. We’re here to rectify that.', 'In 2023, Shah Rukh Khan reminded us all why he was christened King Khan in the first place. SRK, as he’s widely known, had three releases in the last year, and two of them went on to become the biggest hits of his illustrious 33-year film career. In fact, they’re the two biggest Bollywood movies ever, after Aamir Khan’s Dangal.', 'Khan has always been a pioneer of sorts, be it playing the anti-hero when his peers only took on the roles of sweet, romantic leads, or bringing top-notch VFX to India with or dancing at weddings for side income. But the last few years haven’t been as kind. His films weren’t the mega-hits he was delivering a decade ago. Some of the more experimental ones like Fan (2016) and Zero (2018) flatlined at the box office, and drew flak from critics and audiences alike. And then of course, covid was devastating to the industry as a whole.', 'But his recent bout of success, Khan has brought all screens—multiplexes, single screens, and TV, phone, and laptop screens—to life.

In Pathaan, Jawan, and Dunki, he plays an intelligence officer, an army-man-turned-vigilante, and a former soldier–simply put, a patriot. In Jawan, he even broke the fourth wall to call upon India’s 1.4 billion population to ask questions and vote smart.', 'The box office numbers are testament to the fact that the public is on Khan’s side. “Some of you may have not even liked [the movies].

He’d applied for a job as a baggage handler at the local airport, and that afternoon he’d been called up to interview with a robot.', 'Schellmann was intrigued. By the following April, she’d attend her first HR tech conference, where she watched a company called HireVue present a new kind of video interview: one that used AI to analyze candidates’ facial movements and tone of voice to determine how well they matched a role. That analysis could be used to make—or deny—a job offer. “It seemed like magic,” Schellmann recalls. But when she began to ask questions about the science behind the analysis, she says, she realized there wasn’t any.', 'Now a range of HR software promises that AI can help companies make better hires than humans. AI is already coming for our job applications: More than 80% of employers use it to make hiring decisions, US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission chair Charlotte Burrows estimated in 2023. Today robots screen our resumes and record our first interviews to recommend the best hires. But they don’t stop there: Some ask us to play AI video games, where pumping a virtual balloon supposedly sheds light on your professional aptitudes. Some listen in on our interview calls, evaluating our words to predict our soft skills. Still others scan our social media in a flash, compiling Cambridge Analytica–style personality profiles for our future employers. Plenty don’t need our permission to get started—and we’ll often never know we were evaluated by an algorithm.', 'In her new book, The Algorithm: How AI Decides Who Gets Hired, Monitored, Promoted, and Fired and Why We Need to Fight Back Now, Schellmann peers into the black box deciding whether or not we get a job—and finds that the machines are just as flawed as the people who build them. Posing as a candidate, she uncovers their failings firsthand: Transcription tools give her high marks in English after she speaks to them in German; social media screeners spit out opposing personality profiles based on whether they look at her Twitter or her LinkedIn.', 'Meanwhile, Schellmann talks with more than 200 people—employment lawyers, organizational psychologists, regulators, recruiters, candidates, and the machine makers themselves—to uncover how these tools not only replicate human biases, but produce entirely new ways to discriminate.', 'Quartz spoke with Schellmann about how hiring came to involve fewer humans and more computers, along with what job candidates can do to take back some control. This interview has been edited and condensed for length and clarity.', 'Quartz: The vast majority of job hunters encounter some kind of AI as they look for open roles. (All of the large job platforms—like LinkedIn, Indeed, ZipRecruiter, and Monster—confirm that they use AI, although they’re not required to disclose exactly where or how it works.) Why do companies buy additional AI tools from vendors?', 'Hilke Schellmann: The advent of job boards like LinkedIn and Monster [has] been wonderful for applicants —you can send your resumes to lots and lots of people and jobs every day. On the other hand, that has led to companies feeling they’re getting [deluged], and they can’t read them all. For example, Google says they get about 3 million applicants every year. There’s no way that human recruiters can go through all of these resumes or applications, and so these companies need a technological solution.', 'That’s what AI vendors cater to, to say, “Hey, we have a great solution. It’s efficient, it will save you money, and it will find the most qualified candidates for the job without any bias.” We’ve seen proof that [the technology] is very efficient and saves a lot of money. We haven’t found a lot of evidence to prove that it finds the most qualified candidates, or that there is less bias.', 'AI tools are built on human-based data—in the case of resume screeners, for example, the AI is trained on resumes of current employees and taught to look for patterns among them. In some cases, that can reflect existing disparities back at us; in more than one case, AI trained on data from a male-dominated team learned to downrank women. In some cases, it can produce entirely new biases. How do those flaws get caught?', 'Every so often, companies bring in outside counsel and outside lawyers to evaluate these tools. [Former employment lawyer] Matthew Scheier told me that none of the tools he looked at when he was an employment lawyer were ready for primetime. [Software auditor] John Scott, the COO of [HR consulting firm] APTMetrics, looked at five resume screeners and found problems in all five. [Whistleblower and former employment lawyer] Ken Willner said he found problematic variables in about a quarter of them. It’s not a random fluke—it’s actually a pattern that things go wrong. There’s bias, and possible discrimination and harm, that these tools cost.', 'Willner was really concerned when he looked at one of the resume screeners and found one of the variables predicted upon was the word “Africa,” [like in] “African” and “African American.” That would constitute race discrimination. Our skin color should have nothing to do with whether we’re chosen or rejected for a job. [Another evaluator] found that the word “Thomas” in one resume screener was predictable. My apologies to all the Thomases out there, but the name Thomas doesn’t qualify you for any job.', 'Something else that shocked me was that instances of bias in the AI tools were never discovered by the vendor themselves, according to Willner. They were found exclusively when a company using the tool brought in a third-party auditor.', 'A lot of [what I call predictive AI tools] use machine learning, and they often use deep neural networks. So the developers themselves often don’t know exactly what the tools actually predict [or] how they reach the results of their conclusions. I think that should all worry us.', 'You also write about how these tools leave a tremendous amount of space to discriminate against people with disabilities—and seem to fly under legal radars doing it.', 'People with disabilities are a huge part of the population—about 10 to 20% in the US, maybe even more. Disabilities can be visible, invisible, physical, mental; there’s all kinds of variation, [and] disability might express itself very differently. So even if I’m autistic, and my data is being fed into an AI system, it doesn’t actually mean that people with autism are adequately represented in the training data. There’s an individual expression of disabilities that cannot be adequately represented in a system that looks for statistically relevant patterns.', 'I think a lot of folks on the hiring side say, “Well, the law says that folks who have a disability can have a reasonable accommodation”—for example, if you encounter a one-way video interview and are deaf or hard of hearing, or you have a speech impairment, maybe the company would put a human on the other end. But what I’ve learned speaking to vocational counselors who work with people with disabilities, tragically, is that every time they’re asked for a reasonable accommodation, which is the law, they’ve never heard back. I think it’s getting harder and harder because we have more automatic screens in the hiring pipeline.', 'So how can candidates regain some agency, or feel like they can do something to better equip themselves for AI to read their job application?', 'There are some lessons to be learned here for job seekers. I want to preface this by saying I don’t know everything about every tool that is in use.', 'We used to tell people, “Oh, make your resume stand out; make it eye-catching.” Now it’s the opposite advice: Make your resume machine-readable. Not two columns, just one column; clear text; short, crisp sentences. Use easily quantifiable information. If you have a license—for example, a nursing license—put that on there. Maybe even put the licensing numbers there [so] a computer can look up that you are licensed to practice, or something like that.', 'I think for a lot of people, it’s really empowering to use ChatGPT and other generative AI to proofread their resumes [or draft] cover letters. There are jokes on employment platforms where people joke, like, “Oh yeah, let the better AI win…my cover letter’s written by AI, and the companies all use AI [to read it].” I think that feels empowering to some job applicants. I think generative AI has changed the power balance just a little bit.', 'Honestly, reading about some of this AI software gives me a very dystopian feeling—but it’s nice to know that those public-facing tools have democratized it, if just a little.', 'I do think we’re just at the beginning and now pulling out the errors. Maybe we’re moving a little bit this curtain of secrecy and to show, “Hey, this is what’s already happening. We see all of these problems.” Let’s push for some changes—like, let’s push for more transparency, possibly more regulation. But let’s also put pressure on companies to do the right thing.', 'While I was writing the book, I was like, “I think there needs to be [some] huge civil society organizations that test these tools, but also build tools in the public interest.” So maybe, you know, someone or an organization could build a tool like a resume screener that is not biased. Maybe we can put that in the public interest, into the public domain, and push companies to use the tools that are not discriminatory.', 'Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.', '']"

A new study from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) offers a reassuring perspective: most jobs are currently too expensive to automate with AI.', 'The study, authored by five MIT researchers and titled Beyond AI Exposure, delves deep into the practicalities of replacing human labor with AI in the US, focusing on tasks that lend themselves to computer vision, such as those performed by teachers, property appraisers, and  bakers.', 'Surprisingly, the authors found that only 23% of workers’ wages for such jobs could be cost-effectively replaced by AI. “Even with a 50% annual cost decrease, it will take until 2026 before half of the vision tasks have a machine economic advantage,” states the 45-page study seen by Quartz. “By 2042 there will still exist tasks that are exposed to computer vision, but where human labor has the advantage.”', 'The researchers predict that even with a 20% drop in cost  per year, it would still take decades for computer vision tasks to become economically efficient for companies. Financed by the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab, the study used online surveys to gather information on about 1,000 visually assisted tasks spanning 800 occupations. Right now, only 3% of these tasks can be economically automated, but the researchers suggest that this figure could increase to 40% by 2030, contingent on lower data costs and improvements in accuracy.', 'While AI excels at recognizing patterns and analyzing images, the technology behind it comes with hefty installation and maintenance costs. In many cases, it’s simply cheaper to rely on human skills and intuition. Plus, AI already has a power consumption problem,\xa0and companies are struggling to implement AI systems.', 'Unlike humans, who have both conscious and subconscious thought processes, AI mostly uses statistical and symbolic reasoning. So it struggles with tasks that require intuition, gut feeling, and implicit knowledge, which often inform human critical thinking and emotional intelligence. Those traits will continue to be irreplaceable in the evolving job market.', 'Of course, AI is still impacting\xa0many jobs.\xa0Industries like banking, marketing, retail, legal services, transportation, and healthcare are prime candidates for increased automation, thanks to their repetitive tasks and the potential for cost savings. A 2023 report (pdf) from Goldman Sachs estimates that around 300 million jobs, or 18% of work globally, could be affected by generative AI. The MIT study also acknowledges that advancements in AI, like improved data efficiency and accuracy, could significantly boost its automation potential.', 'But for now, anyway, the “machines will steal our jobs” narrative seems exaggerated.', 'Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.', '']"

It makes sense, then, that a pair of activist investor groups would suggest that ExxonMobil Corp., the world’s largest privately owned oil company, do something to help cut down on all that consumption. ExxonMobil responded by suing the groups in US federal court, a very expensive, vehement Uh, no.', 'The case, filed in federal district court in Texas, stems from the latest in a yearslong series of shareholder proposals by the Dutch-based collective Follow This and the US-based Arjuna Capital. The proposal, which other shareholders would vote on at Exxon’s annual meeting in May, would force the company to take more responsibility for all the greenhouse gas emissions released by the end users of its products. Though the oil giant has pledged to cut its own global emissions to net zero by 2050, those efforts only cover Exxon’s actions and not those of its customers. Follow This made similar proposals in 2022 and 2023 that shareolders overwhelmingly voted down in both cases.', 'Exxon said it had taken the extreme action, the first time in corporate history it has ever sued to block a shareholder measure, because the groups were “driven by an extreme agenda” that put climate goals ahead of its ability to make money. Plus, it doesn’t want to keep having to reject the same unpopular request year after year. But Follow This, which argues that time is running out to address climate change and that such proposals are finding increasing levels of support at other oil companies, is itching for a fight.', '“With this remarkable step, ExxonMobil clearly wants to prevent shareholders using their voting rights,” Mark van Baal, founder of Follow This, said in a statement. “Apparently, the board fears investors will vote in favour of emissions reduction targets.

But Kirkuk is important to Iraq itself, and no Iraqi prime minister can afford to lose Kirkuk.', 'So you can see this reaction that has taken place following the referendum on independence, which happened September the 25th, and also included the disputed territories and the city of Kirkuk.', 'JUDY WOODRUFF:', 'Feisal Istrabadi, what can you add to why the Iraqi government is so set on taking over the city?', 'FEISAL ISTRABADI, Former Deputy UN Ambassador, Iraq:', 'Well, a couple of reasons.', 'First, as Emma just said, it is a part of the disputed territories, which are legally and constitutionally under the jurisdiction of the federal government in Baghdad. The KRG expanded into these disputed territories at the time when ISIL was expanding its territory, and then began to take steps to unilaterally declare that these areas were now incorporated into the Kurdistan region, including when it held the referendum that Emma talked about.', ""It included holding the referendum in these disputed territories. Now, so long as Iraq — so long as we're talking about a single country, it matters a little less who controls Kirkuk, but once the referendum was held, this gave rise then to the second reason for Baghdad choosing to act now."", 'As Emma said, Kirkuk is an important oil-producing zone in Iraq. And it is vital for the economic viability of an independent Kurdish state and an important part of the economic viability of the Iraqi state. So there was never going to be a scenario, I think, in which Baghdad would allow a unilateral exercise of control by Kurds to occur over Kirkuk, so long as independence is on the table.', 'JUDY WOODRUFF:', 'Emma Sky, we heard President Trump say today the U.S. is not taking sides in this.', ""Is that accurate, that the U.S. isn't taking sides? What is the U.S. role here?"", 'EMMA SKY:', 'Well, the U.S. has stipulated over and over again that its policy is to support a united Iraq.', 'So you can see the U.S. has given support to Iraqi security forces, but also to the Kurdish Peshmerga, to fight against ISIS. The U.S. policy for the last few years has really been focused on ISIS and not on the day after ISIS.', ""But what we're witnessing at the moment is that different groups are already moving to the day after, which is the power struggle for control of different territories in Iraq."", 'And Barzani believed that during the fight against ISIS, he became stronger because he got weapons directly from the international community. And, as Feisal said, he was able to extend his control over the disputed territories.', ""He's also facing domestic problems within Kurdistan. There are tensions between the different Kurdish groups, and some believe that Barzani has overstayed his term as president."", 'JUDY WOODRUFF:', 'Which reminds us just how complicated this is, Feisal Istrabadi.', ""What does the Iraqi central government want here? They're not going to get rid of the Kurds. What is it that they want?"", 'FEISAL ISTRABADI:', ""Oh, well, I mean, the Kurds of course are a vital part of Iraq. They're a vital part of the political process, and they have been represented in Baghdad. The president of Iraq is a Kurd and has been since 2005."", 'I think what needs to occur and I hope what the government of Iraq wants is a negotiated settlement, in which no party dictates terms to the other, but a negotiated settlement.', ""Look, Irbil has some legitimate agreements with respect to Baghdad. Baghdad has some legitimate agreements with respect to Irbil. I think we need a mediator perhaps or somebody to convene a roundtable — the United States is who I'm thinking of, of course — to address some of those issues."", ""Most of the issues are, from the Irbil side, economic issues of payments, and from Baghdad's side, transparency of how much oil Irbil is producing and exporting, which Irbil has never accounted for to Baghdad."", 'I think if those issues are resolved, perhaps hopefully some of these other issues can at least be delayed for another day. But at the end of the day, neither government — neither the regional government nor the federal government in Baghdad can really tolerate dictation of terms to it by the other side. My hope is that a negotiated settlement obtains.', 'JUDY WOODRUFF:', 'Emma Sky, where do you see this going from here? Do you see the peace that different sides have worked to hard to create in Iraq unraveling as a result of this?', 'EMMA SKY:', ""I think there is an opportunity for a deal, and I think the sort of deal that could be negotiated is one that looks at a special status for the city of Kirkuk and negotiated terms for Kurdistan's separate, whether that be towards confederation or towards independence."", 'But there needs to be negotiation. There needs to be a look at where should the border between Iraqi Kurdistan and the rest of Iraq actually be, and that requires mediation district by district through those territories.', 'JUDY WOODRUFF:', 'Well, we know there are other players who are playing an important role here in Iran and Turkey, and this is all very much playing out as we watch, watch it happen in Iraq.', 'Emma Sky, Feisal Istrabadi, thank you very much.', 'FEISAL ISTRABADI:', 'Thank you.', 'EMMA SKY:', 'Thank you.', 'Watch the Full Episode', 'Oct 16', 'By PBS NewsHour', 'Oct 16', 'By PBS NewsHour', 'PBS NewsHour\n\n\n                    PBS NewsHour', 'Support Provided By:\nLearn more', 'Subscribe to Here’s the Deal, our politics\n                 newsletter for analysis you won’t find anywhere\xa0else.', 'Thank you.

Over the course of four days, we walked more than 40 miles through the bush, escorted by rebel soldiers, to shed light on one of the world’s most underreported conflicts.', 'Reporting on South Sudan’s war, which began in 2013, has always been a challenge due to the risk and logistical hurdles associated with accessing remote areas where fighting takes place. But over the past year, covering the war and its humanitarian fallout has become particularly difficult. Since the beginning of this year, South Sudan’s government has banned at least 20 foreign journalists in an apparent effort to silence reporters who had a track record of critically reporting on the government.', 'This systematic crackdown on the foreign press (South Sudanese journalists have long risked imprisonment and death for doing their work) coincided with two important developments. In November 2016, the United Nations warned that the violence being committed against civilians in the southern region of Equatoria risked spiraling into genocide. Then, in February, the UN declared a man-made famine, warning that 100,000 people were at risk of starving to death as a result of civil war.', 'Journalists seeking to cover these events were left with two equally unsavory options: self-censorship or a risky trip to rebel-held parts of the country. Only a handful of journalists have attempted the latter since fighting escalated in July last year. For us, this was our second embed with the rebels this year.', 'Martin Abucha (second from right) rests with his troops in rebel-held South Sudan. Photo by Jason Patinkin', 'We set off from a town in northern Uganda at five in the morning, bouncing along a bumpy dirt track towards the South Sudan border. Crammed into our four-wheel drive were rebel commander Martin Abucha, a dual American and South Sudanese citizen who we planned to profile for our PBS NewsHour Weekend segment, a couple of guides, and several duffle bags stuffed with our tents, sleeping bags, emergency medical kits and provisions to last us four days.', 'Just as the sun began to rise above a distant range of hills that we aimed to cross later that day, our car came to a halt in front of a stream. Because of the rainy reason, it carried more water than usual. It was time to disembark and start walking, or “footing,” as South Sudanese tend to call it.', 'We took off our shoes and waded through the stream’s chilly waters. This was the first of a many rivers we’d have to cross along the way, either on foot or in small flimsy canoes dug out from tree trunks. Each time, we dreaded the idea of falling in with our camera gear.', 'The first part of our journey in northern Uganda felt very much like a hike through a national park. Passing beautiful landscapes and idyllic farming villages, one could almost forget we were headed into a war zone — but we were about to get a reality check.', 'We had just crossed into South Sudan when out of nowhere, two dozen armed men popped out of the tall grass and surrounded us at gunpoint.', '“Stop! Who are you and where are you going,” a soldier called out in Juba Arabic from his hideout no more than 20 yards away, pointing his AK47 at us. Another one next to him had a rocket-propelled grenade propped on his shoulder, also unequivocally aiming it in our direction.', 'Instinctively, we threw our hands in the air and exchanged a baffled glance. Had we accidentally bumped into government soldiers? Or perhaps we had come onto the “wrong” rebels? Abucha’s group, called the Sudan People’s Liberation Army In Opposition, is the biggest but not the only armed group in Equatoria, an area rife with rival militia and bandits who exploit the security vacuum left by war.', 'To our relief, and only after Abucha answered a series of questions, this routine security check quickly gave way to a warm welcome. The platoon would be our escort for the next four days as we trekked to their base and to Loa, Abucha’s hometown.', 'Keeping up with the rebels was no easy task. Given the country’s pervasive lack of basic infrastructure, South Sudanese grow up walking for dozens of miles just to go about their daily lives. For sedentary Westerners, keeping the target pace of “two meters per second” (around five miles an hour) proved challenging amid 90-degree temperatures, all while filming and plowing our way through dense, itchy elephant grass.', 'The upside of the cumbersome terrain was that it kept us safe. During our four-day trip, we didn’t cross a single road, instead walking along a dizzying network of narrow bush paths the rebels seemed to know like the backs of their hands. An unwanted encounter with government troops, who tended to stick to roads and move around in vehicles as opposed to on foot, was highly unlikely.', 'The closest we got to government-controlled area was a visit to Loa, located just two kilometers away from a main road frequently patrolled by government soldiers. We couldn’t stay long, but the hour we spent on the ground offered us a glimpse into what villages must look like in many parts of Equatoria: burned mud huts, looted schools and clinics, fallow fields and – most strikingly – no civilians.', 'The war has had a devastating impact on South Sudanese communities like the one in Loa, but much of it has remained out of the limelight of international media. Our four-day venture into rebel-held South Sudan offered us a rare opportunity to report ground truths, and we are thankful for that.', 'Above:\n                Simona Foltyn walks down a mountain slope shortly after crossing into South Sudan.

The case involves two competing restaurants and families, each claiming a lineage with the city's renowned Moti Mahal restaurant founded in 1947, and each calling themselves the inventors of the popular dish."", ""The lawsuit - brought by the family of Kundan Lal Gujral, one the original restaurant's founders - claims that Gujral created the curry and has sued rival chain Daryaganj of falsely taking credit for it."", 'The Gujral family, which is seeking $240,000 (£188,968) in damages, has also alleged that Daryaganj has wrongly claimed it invented dal makhani, a lentil dish made with butter and cream.', ""But it's butter chicken that has dominated headlines."", 'There are countless versions of how butter chicken was invented, but all of them start with a man called Mokha Singh, feature three of his employees and involve at least three different restaurants located across the subcontinent.', 'The lore goes back to pre-Independent India and inside the dusty lanes of Peshawar (now in Pakistan), where a young Singh ran a popular restaurant called Moti Mahal, says chef and food writer Sadaf Hussain.', 'In 1947, when India was partitioned, Singh and several of his Hindu employees fled Peshawar and moved to the Indian capital. Soon they lost touch with each other.', 'Until one day, when three of them - Kundan Lal Gujral, his cousin Kundan Lal Jaggi, and Thakur Das Mago - ran into Singh at a makeshift liquor joint, and convinced him to let them open a new Moti Mahal in Delhi.', 'It was at this small open-air diner, located on the crowded Daryaganj street in the old quarters of Delhi, that butter chicken was born, Mr Hussain says.', 'The idea was born out of frugality, using leftover tikkas and mixing it in a thick tomato gravy and dollops of butter. But it did wonders.', 'Within a year, ministers and heads of state, including India\'s first prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru, had become regular customers at Moti Mahal. ""Peace treaties were hammered out in the balcony. And M Maulana Azad... reportedly told the Shah of Iran that while in India he must make two visits - to the Taj Mahal and Moti Mahal,"" The New York Times wrote of Moti Mahal in 1984.', 'For a long time, Kundan Lal Gujral - whom the newspaper described as ""a portly, florid"" man with a ""splendid moustache"" - was credited for both, the butter chicken recipe and the restaurant\'s booming success.', 'But things changed after his death, Mr Hussain says. In 1997, the Gujral family and his partners had to lease out Moti Mahal after facing prolonged financial difficulties. (The restaurant is now run by a different family)', 'A few years later, the Gujrals launched a separate chain - this time calling it Moti Mahal Delux - and returned to business, opening franchises across the city.', 'But another setback awaited them in 2019, when the grandson of the second partner, Kundan Lal Jaggi, opened a rival chain of restaurants called Daryaganj, added the description ""By the inventors of Butter Chicken and Dal Makhani"", and trademarked it.', 'The owners of Daryaganj argued that while Mr Gujral was the face of the restaurant, Mr Jaggi handled the kitchen and so the dishes, including butter chicken, were all his ideas.', 'The Gujrals, however, rejected this and claimed that Mr Jaggi was a junior partner who did not play a major role in the making of the menu, and that butter chicken, in fact, was created by Mr Gujral while he was still in Peshawar.', 'That\'s the battle currently playing out in court: the family is demanding that owners of Daryaganj be restrained from calling themselves the inventors of butter chicken. ""You cannot take away somebody\'s legacy,"" Kundan Lal Gujral\'s grandson, who has filed the lawsuit, recently told Reuters news agency.', 'This is not the first time that someone has gone to such lengths to claim ownership of a dish.', 'A bitter tussle broke out between the eastern states of Odisha (formerly Orissa) and West Bengal over which of them invented the rasgulla, a plump sweet milk and cheese dumpling lathered in a sugary syrup. The question was finally put to rest in 2018, after Geographical Indication (GI) authorities ruled in favour of Bengal.', ""In recent years, chefs too have invoked intellectual property rights to defend their restaurants, their signature style and dishes, although it's still rare for a case to reach the courts."", 'But such disputes are usually commercial in nature and have little to do with customers, says food writer Vir Sanghvi. ""People go to restaurants to eat dishes they like and don\'t really care who invented them decades ago.""', 'He adds that sometimes, dishes become so popular that their inventors are forgotten. ""Who created the first masala dosa? Some versions give the credit to the Woodlands restaurant chain. Others dispute this and nobody cares enough to dig deeper.""', 'Mr Hussain agrees. ""How food travels is magical. It could be through parallel sources,"" he says. ""People move, they take their recipes with them, adjusting it to local palates along the way.""', ""He gives the example of the UK, where a Pakistan-born restaurateur from Glasgow is widely credited with the invention of chicken tikka masala. But many cooks, especially at Bangladeshi restaurants, claim that they came up with the recipe. Others say the masala wasn't invented in Britain at all, but came from Punjab."", 'That\'s why the fight for butter chicken is also inconsequential, he adds, because the dish goes beyond one restaurant and is found everywhere. ""You might get credit for inventing it, but what truly matters is who serves better quality,"" says Mr Hussain.', ""In Moti Mahal's case, things are likely to be trickier because the dispute isn't about whether the restaurant created butter chicken; it's about which of its owners played a bigger role in its invention."", '""It is the story of two men fighting for their grandfathers\' legacies. And those disputes are often the hardest to settle,"" Mr Sanghvi says.', 'According to lawyers, the court would have to rely on ""circumstantial evidence"" and testimonies of people who had the dish decades ago. But even then, how would the judges determine who made the first pot?', 'It is possible that one of the partners had a handwritten recipe which could help settle the issue, Mr Sanghvi says. ""So far this has not come to light.""', 'But the owners of Daryaganj know that even if they retract their claims about inventing the dish, it would make no difference to their business. And despite the success of Daryaganj, Moti Mahal would continue to flourish as well, Mr Sanghvi adds.', '""Either way, it is going to be hard to tell, so many decades later, what really went on in the kitchen.""', 'BBC News India is now on YouTube.

A 51-inch (4.25-ft) statue of the deity, specially commissioned for the temple, was unveiled last week. The idol has been placed on a marble pedestal in the sanctum sanctorum.', ""Thousands of police were deployed for Monday's event, despite Mr Modi having appealed to pilgrims not to turn up and to watch the ceremony on television.

The eastern state of Odisha (Orissa) unveiled huge plans to bring pilgrims to the Jagannath temple in Puri, one of the holiest sites for Hindus.', 'Authorities say they expect more than 150,000 visitors per day once the temple in Ayodhya is fully ready.', 'To accommodate this expected rush, new hotels are being built and existing ones spruced up as part of a major makeover and in recent weeks, a new airport and railway station have opened.', 'Officials say they are building a ""world-class city where people come as pilgrims and tourists"", but many local people have told the BBC that their homes, shops and ""structures of religious nature"" have been either completely or partially demolished to expand roads and set up other facilities.', 'Temple rises from ruins of one of India’s darkest days', 'Transforming a flashpoint holy city into the ‘Hindu Vatican’', ""The complex history of India's Ayodhya holy site"", 'The man who helped Lord Ram win the Ayodhya case', 'Crisis-hit China Evergrande ordered to liquidate', 'Iran denies involvement in drone strike that killed three US troops', ""Gaza's largest aid agency 'desperate' after funds paused"", ""'It's a dream come true to work with Zayn Malik'"", 'The Sufi shrine caught up in a religious row in India', 'Death in the Channel - what led a boy to make fatal journey?', 'One-time giant of African air travel mounts comeback', 'BBC confronts man who abused boy in secretive Christian church', 'The country with the earliest wake-up time in the world.

Adani Ports denies this.', 'The 330-acre multi-purpose port - originally built by Indian conglomerate Larson & Toubro (L&T) - was acquired by Adani Ports in 2018.', 'The company later proposed to expand it more than 18-fold to an area of 6,110 acres by claiming portions of land along the coast.', ""According to the company's master plan, the expansion would increase the port's cargo capacity from 24.6 metric tonnes to 320 metric tonnes per year and develop new rail and road networks that would boost trade connectivity in the region."", 'But fisher people in at least 100 towns and villages located on the coast say this would gravely impact their work.

Any kind of expansion would further deplete its population,"" claims Rajalakshmi, a fisherwoman from the region.', 'The expansion has met with resistance from environmentalists as well, who claim the plan would lead to massive coastal erosion and a loss of biodiversity, especially of the indigenous fish species and the crabs, prawns and small turtles found in the region.', 'Environmentalist Meera Shah claims it could also ""destroy"" Pulicat lake, the second-largest saltwater lake in the country.', 'At the moment, the coastal stretch acts as a barrier between the lake and the Bay of Bengal.

It also plans to deepen a portion of the sea and create a sea wall around it so that more ships can move along the coast.', ""Experts warn this could have devastating consequences for the region's ecology."", 'The east coast of India - and the Tamil Nadu coast in particular - does not have the geographical landscape suitable for port construction, let alone an expansion, claims Dr Ilango Lakshmanan, a professor of hydrogeology at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Madras.', '""This would disrupt the coastal topography and lead to more sea erosion,"" he added.', ""A senior company spokesperson rejected the claim and said that sea erosion in the region could not be linked to the port's construction alone."", '""States like Gujarat and Maharashtra, where some of the major ports in the country are located, have lower rates of sea erosion compared to the east coast,"" the spokesperson said.', ""But some industry experts also say the expansion plan should not be dismissed entirely as it would benefit the state's economy and bring more employment."", '""Kattupalli port was facing losses and started making profits only after the Adani takeover.

In that time, they own four of the nine Test wins any visiting teams have managed.', 'That takes nothing away from the size of the task ahead of them over the next five matches and seven weeks. India have lost only three of their past 46 Tests on home soil. Winning a series in India is the greatest challenge in cricket, arguably in all of sport.', 'It does not mean England arrive without hope, enthusiasm or excitement. Starting a movement to revolutionise Test cricket and going the best part of two years without a series defeat breeds plenty of confidence.', ""Ben Stokes' side might be wishing for an overseas tour with a smooth build-up. Last winter it was illness in Pakistan and Cyclone Gabrielle in New Zealand; this time it is Harry Brook leaving the tour for personal reasons and the fiasco of Shoaib Bashir's visa."", ""Spirts are undimmed, though. A training camp in Abu Dhabi has brought the squad back together after an unusually long break from Test cricket that stretches back to last summer's Ashes."", 'It is certainly unconventional for a team to arrive in India with only three days to go before the first Test and not to play a warm-up game, especially with the England Lions being in the country at the same time.', 'Past players will chunter, but the reality is the game has changed. Modern-day cricketers spend so much time in India that the conditions hold no surprises, and warm-ups against local second-string first-class players bear no resemblance to Test cricket. Maybe, just maybe, the old boys are lamenting the fact that they never had it this good.', 'The current crop have raved about their time in Abu Dhabi, not least coach McCullum, who joked about ironing out some problems with his golf swing.', 'In terms of preparation, England were able to tailor to their needs much more easily than in India. They scuffed up the nets and found sand to put on the pitches for middle practice, the kind of behaviour that would have been given short shrift by groundstaff in Hyderabad.', 'If England start slowly, like they did in the Ashes after a questionable golf trip to Loch Lomond, they know their preparations will be a stick with which to beat them.', 'However, all the players have arrived in India looking impressively fit and ready for the job in hand. For the Test specialists, such a long time without playing has allowed some prolonged strength and conditioning work, and the results are clear.', 'Jack Leach has bulked up after his back injury. Ollie Robinson has slimmed down but has hair of a shocking silver colour. James Anderson, lean and with blond highlights, looks like Brad Pitt in Fight Club. His duel in the nets with Joe Root on Tuesday had a Test-match intensity to it.', 'The players are incredibly relaxed. Mark Wood has lamented the severity of the haircut he was subjected to in Abu Dhabi, while Jonny Bairstow - practically a local after his time playing for Sunrisers Hyderabad in the Indian Premier League - has dished out recommendations not only for the best restaurants, but what to eat there too.', 'Managing director Rob Key took part in slip-catching practice without changing out of his polo shirt and chinos, and managed to hang on to a few. Of everyone here, this series is perhaps of most importance to Key, who came under fire for some of his decisions during the awful World Cup campaign last autumn and will be hoping that the calls on selection and preparation make England at the very least competitive.', 'Most eyes have been on captain Stokes, about to play for the first time since having surgery on his troublesome left knee in November.', 'What was described at the time as a ""clean-out"" was actually much more than that, with stitches put in his meniscus and bone spurs removed. He will not bowl on this tour - the wait to see Stokes turn his arm over again is like waiting for Godot - but he is another who looks in supreme physical shape.', 'Stokes has lost weight to ease the burden on his knee and aid the recovery from the operation. Always a maniacal trainer, he was sprinting shuttles on the outfield as if his life depended on it.', ""Without Stokes being able to bowl, England's selection was destined to be ticklish. The most recent Test they played in India - in Ahmedabad in 2021 - he was the second seamer to Anderson. Without that luxury, England have had to decide between a second frontline seamer or a third spinner."", 'With India coach Rahul Dravid saying the pitch ""may turn"" - possibly code for it being a raging Bunsen burner - England have gone for the latter. Wood is the sole seamer and Leach leads a spin trio including Rehan Ahmed and Tom Hartley.', 'The plan seems sound - too often England have come here and relied on pace, only to get hammered - but there is the question over whether the tourists have the personnel for it to work. Ahmed and Hartley have one Test cap and 64 first-class wickets between them. To spin out India is a huge ask.', 'Still, the India batting is not quite as fearsome as it might have been, especially with Virat Kohli missing the first two Tests for personal reasons.', 'Given their strength arguably lies in their bowling, the pitches India choose to play on will be fascinating.', ""England's swashbuckling batters will attack, backing themselves to score runs whatever the conditions, but turning pitches would certainly give the inexperienced touring bowlers a leg up. It might be a more advisable strategy for India to prepare flat tracks, in the knowledge that their bowlers are more likely than England's to take 20 wickets."", 'One crucial - perhaps overlooked - element will be the batting depth of the teams. Whereas England had Moeen Ali and Chris Woakes to balance their side in the Ashes, neither is here now.', ""Ahmed has a first-class hundred and all of Hartley, Wood and Leach can bat, but India will have the highly capable Ravindra Jadeja, Ravichandran Ashwin and probably Axar Patel as their seven, eight and nine. Don't be surprised if lower-order runs become one of the deciding factors of the series."", ""In the past 30 years more people from the UK have held the office of home secretary than have played in a men's Test series win in India, and Stokes acknowledged that winning even one Test could be seen as a major accomplishment."", ""More broadly, after a winter of white-ball discontent, it is a sheer joy to have the prospect of England playing Test cricket once again. The world's most exciting cricket team in the world's most fanatical cricketing nation."", 'What is success? A series win would be one for the ages, two Tests an incredible achievement. One victory seems realistic, and staying competitive throughout nothing to be sniffed at.', 'It is all relative.', 'Featuring unseen police footage and interviews with the officers at the heart of the case', 'A real-life murder mystery following three brothers in their quest for the truth', 'Uncover the hidden systems and armies of people running Hong Kong', 'Just how quick, cheap and easy is it to obtain fabricated documentation?', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']"

The disputed site sits on one of its biggest religious fault-lines - thousands were killed in the violence that broke out."", ""More than 30 years later, where the mosque once stood a grand temple to Lord Ram, one of Hinduism's most revered deities, is about to be opened by India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi. That's controversial in a country with a secular constitution, but especially so because of the divisive history of the site."", ""Monday's ceremony is being seen as the informal start of his campaign for re-election this year, wooing India's Hindu majority.

They are heretics, leftists, extremists and terrorists.', '""We did not go to another country to destroy their places of worship, but if they destroyed ours, then it is right that we get them back.""', 'Muslims regularly offered prayers in the mosque until 1949, when idols of Lord Ram were placed in it, allegedly by Hindu priests. The gates of the mosque were then closed by a court order. In 1986, they were re-opened, many believe at the behest of the Congress party, then in power, in a rumoured attempt to woo the Hindu majority.', 'Then in 1990, the Hindu Nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) - then just a small political party with little electoral success - spearheaded a mass campaign for a Hindu temple at the site. The campaign would later be seen as one of the key moments which transformed BJP into the virtually unbeatable political giant it is today, which now has Mr Modi at its head.', 'That year, tens of thousands of kar sevaks congregated in Ayodhya. When they started moving towards the disputed site, police fired at them, killing dozens. ""Those bullets fuelled our anger,"" Santosh Dubey says. He was injured in the shooting.', 'Two years later, kar sevaks gathered in Ayodhya again.', '""The people who were guarding the disputed structure fled when they saw a huge crowd walking towards them with swords and hammers.

We never found his body,"" she says breaking down.', 'When she returned to her home, she found it had been burnt to the ground. It would take time, but over the years the family would manage to rebuild a small, two-room home on the same site.', '""My husband used to take care of our family. I was left alone with six small children. We got some money from the government but it was not enough. My life was destroyed by that day,"" she says.', 'In the violence that swept across India after the mosque was torn down, nearly 2,000 people were killed. More than 900 died in the financial capital, Mumbai, alone, roughly two-thirds of them were Muslims.  There were killings in other cities including Jaipur, Bhopal, Ahmedabad and Hyderabad.', ""In Ayodhya, Mohammad Shahid's father Mohammad Sabir was also killed brutally."", '""They beat him and then they poured oil on both him and my uncle and set them on fire.

It also set off a surge in tourist interest in the small island chain that has worried ecological experts and many locals."", 'On his visit to Lakshadweep - a federally administered territory that lies in the Arabian Sea, to the north of Maldives - Mr Modi had announced a slew of development projects and shared photos of himself snorkelling and enjoying its beaches.', 'Three Maldivian deputy ministers made derogatory comments about him, sparking outrage on Indian social media and prompting many to highlight Lakshadweep as an alternative tourist destination.', ""It seems to be working - Google searches for Lakshadweep, which doesn't often make it to primetime news, jumped to an all-time high last week. MakeMyTrip, India's largest online travel company, said it saw a 3,400% increase in searches for Lakshadweep on its platform after Mr Modi's trip."", 'Praful Patel, the region\'s government administrator whose controversial policies set off ""unprecedented protests"" from locals in Lakshadweep a couple of years ago, has welcomed the attention.', '""The natural beauty of Lakshadweep carries immense possibilities for development of the tourism sector. The administration has launched several initiatives, including adding more rooms,"" he told news agency PTI.', 'The Tata Group has announced plans to open two ""world-class"" resorts on two Lakshadweep islands by 2026 (the archipelago has 36 islands - only 10 are inhabited - spread over 32 sq km (12.3 sq miles)). The only airline that currently flies to Lakshadweep has started additional flights and another plans to launch a service soon.', 'But experts say Lakshadweep - famed for its picturesque silver beaches, crystal-blue waters and coral islands - cannot be developed into a massive tourist destination like the Maldives because of its small size and fragile ecology. Many locals also say that what they need is responsible tourism in which they are stakeholders, not large-scale development plans that will overturn their way of life.', '""The main occupation of the people is fishing, coconut cultivation and coir twisting,"" according to a government website, which calls tourism ""an emerging industry"" here.', ""Until the launch of additional flights, there were only two ways to reach the archipelago - a 72-seater plane operated by Alliance Air that flew daily from Kochi in Kerala state to Lakshadweep's only airport on Agatti island, and ships from the mainland that arrived every four days."", 'Entry to Lakshadweep is also limited by permits issued by the administration.', '""Transport, accommodation and land-based infrastructure are a huge bottleneck [to developing the islands],"" says PP Mohammed Faizal from the Nationalist Congress Party, who is the only MP representing around 70,000 people in Lakshadweep.', '""Bangaram, the island on which PM Modi stayed, has only 36 rooms [for tourists],"" he says.', ""So, much of the territory's current tourism operates through cruises - visitors from ships docked off the archipelago tour the islands during the day and return to the vessel to spend the night."", 'In contrast, Maldives has hundreds of options for tourists to stay, including resorts, hotels and guesthouses.', '""What Maldives has, Lakshadweep can offer by way of beaches, underwater and water sports activities. But infrastructure-wise, we have miles to travel,"" Mr Faizal says.', 'He adds that for any development to take place, the differences between the administration and the islanders will need to be settled.', ""Ninety-six percent of Lakshadweep's population is Muslim and the island has witnessed tensions after Mr Patel - a former leader of Mr Modi's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party - was appointed its administrator in 2021."", 'He has since announced controversial measures including removing meat from school meal menus and a draft law that gives the administration sweeping powers to take over land.', ""The BBC has phoned and emailed queries to Mr Patel's office, Lakshadweep's collector and its tourism and information departments but did not receive responses."", 'In interviews, Mr Patel has defended his administration\'s policies, saying his only agenda was the ""development of Lakshadweep"".', ""Althaf Hussain, who runs a travel agency on Agatti island, says enquiries from prospective tourists have gone up by 30-40% since Mr Modi's visit."", 'While he would welcome more visitors, Mr Hussain - who hopes to set up his own resort on Agatti in future - says that opportunities should go to local entrepreneurs and not just big businesses.', '""We may get small jobs as these projects come in but that\'s not what we want. We want to have ownership in these projects and not just contribute labour,"" he says.', 'Experts say any development in Lakshadweep will need to balance livelihood concerns with climate change fears.', '""The long-term stability of Lakshadweep islands depends on the ecological integrity of her coral reefs, lagoons and beaches,"" says Rohan Arthur, a marine biologist and coral reef ecologist who has researched the islands since 1996. ""These form the vital \'ecological infrastructure\' that holds the atoll together - quite literally.""', 'But he says that over the past few decades, this part of the Indian Ocean has experienced a series of catastrophic heatwaves, linked to the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) weather phenomenon (a warming of the ocean surface) which has affected the health of the coral reefs .', 'With an even bigger ENSO expected this year, he dreads ""to think what it will do to Lakshadweep reefs"".', 'Unplanned or piecemeal development that does not account for climate resilience would only add to the brewing habitability crisis in Lakshadweep, he adds.', 'So what would sustainable tourism look like here?', 'Instead of luxury tourism that leaves a disproportionately high carbon footprint, the archipelago needs a model that puts its fragile ecology and the needs of its people at the centre, experts and locals agree.', 'The islands already have a ""bible for development"", Mr Faizal says, in the form of a plan put forward by the Supreme Court-appointed Justice Ravindran Commission. It was approved by the federal environment ministry in 2015.', 'Mr Patel has said that the plan has been implemented but Mr Faizal claims that the current administration rarely follows the guidelines laid down by the court.', 'The Integrated Island Management Plan recommends the implementation of development projects in consultation with elected local self-government bodies, a ban on dredging and sand mining to protect lagoons, corals and other ecosystems, and tourism projects only in uninhabited islands.', 'Tourists would also be required to visit with a more responsible mindset.', 'Mr Arthur puts forward a vision where a trip to Lakshadweep would include visitors understanding its deep cultural history, eating food that is sustainably sourced and cooked with local recipes, exploring the reef with local guides and divers, and becoming ambassadors for the long-term survival of these unique spaces.', '""It may be possible to imagine a tourism that supports and respects local economies with tourists getting to participate in the life of the village,"" he says.', 'Crisis-hit China Evergrande ordered to liquidate', 'Iran denies involvement in drone strike that killed three US troops', ""Gaza's largest aid agency 'desperate' after funds paused"", ""'It's a dream come true to work with Zayn Malik'"", 'The Sufi shrine caught up in a religious row in India', 'Death in the Channel - what led a boy to make fatal journey?', 'One-time giant of African air travel mounts comeback', 'BBC confronts man who abused boy in secretive Christian church', 'The country with the earliest wake-up time in the world.

A post-mortem report found that Orme had been poisoned with prussic acid - a cyanide-based poison. Her friend, Eva Mount Stephens, 36, was accused of murdering her.', 'The case made global headlines because of the ""peculiarity of the circumstances surrounding it"", as one Australian newspaper noted in 1912. British newspapers carried blow-by-blow accounts of the trial with headlines like \'Mussoorie murder trial\', \'hotel mystery\' and the \'crystal gazing trial\'.', 'Indian author Ruskin Bond, who lives in Mussoorie and has written extensively about the tranquil and verdant hill town, drew a connection between this famous murder and Christie\'s first book in one of his essays. He says that Christie ""used the circumstances of the crime"" in her book as the case was ""quite a sensation"" in its time.', 'According to reports, Orme had been living in India for more than a decade, and had met and befriended Stephens, a spiritualist who hailed from Lucknow city. Orme, a ""lonely woman"", is reported to have learnt crystal-gazing and other occult practices from Stephens.', 'The two had stayed together at the Savoy for a while, during which time Stephens claimed to have looked after Orme as she was in poor health. But the prosecution accused Stephens of administering poison to Orme to benefit from her will as the latter had left her friend a hefty sum of money, three necklaces and other jewellery.', 'The defence, on the other hand, claimed that Orme killed herself because of the ""unceasing grief"" she experienced after the man she came to India to marry died, as well as her own ill-health.', ""The case confounded many, including the police, because of its twists and turns. For one, the investigation revealed that Stephens had left for Lucknow before Orme had died. Secondly, the room in which Orme's body was found was locked from the inside."", ""The police also found no medicines in Orme's rooms except for a bottle of sleeping pills and two labels - that of arsenic and prussic acid."", ""In the early 1900s, buyers had to sign for drugs they bought from a chemist, but the prosecution pointed out that the signature for the prussic acid didn't match the one on Orme's letters."", ""The prosecution also said that Stephens, in conversation with a friend, had predicted Orme's death six months in advance and had also voiced apprehensions about Orme marrying a physician she was engaged to and leaving all her wealth to him."", 'But the defence insisted that Stephens was a ""most devoted companion"" to Orme and that there was no proof that she had either bought or administered the poison to her friend.', 'Stephens was finally acquitted, with the judge remarking that the ""true circumstances of Ms Orme\'s death would probably never be known"".', 'Spoilers ahead for The Mysterious Affair at Styles', ""Christie's book mirrors many of these developments. Emily also dies due to poisoning, and just like Orme, her body is found in a room locked from the inside. It is revealed at the end that it is her companion, Evelyn, who poisons her - it turns out that she bought the poison in disguise, using a forged signature, and that she had a financial motive for killing her friend."", ""She also leaves the Inglethorp residence much before Emily's death. So how exactly did she do it? Only Poirot can answer that!"", 'Decades later, the similarities between the cases continue to intrigue fans - Indian crime writer Manjiri Prabhu spoke about the ""interesting connect"" between Christie\'s first novel and the Mussoorie murder at the International Agatha Christie Festival in 2022.', ""Christie wasn't the only author who was inspired by poison deaths in India. Cecil Walsh chronicled a crime of passion that unfolded in Agra - then a territory under the United Provinces of Agra and Oudh in British-ruled India - and shocked the world. In The Agra Double Murder: A Crime of Passion from the Raj, he writes about how Augusta Fullam, an Englishwoman living in Meerut city, and Dr Clark, an Anglo-Indian man, conspired to poison their respective spouses so that they could be together."", 'Much like in the US and Europe, poisoning cases were common in India in the 19th Century. The sale of toxic substances, particularly arsenic, was unregulated. In his book, Toxic Histories: Poison and Pollution in Modern India, David Arnold writes about how arsenic poisonings provided the ""primary impetus"" for framing of the Indian Poisons Act in 1904 to regulate the sale and use of poisons.', '""When it came, 10 years on, to review the working of the Poisons Act in 1914, the UP (United Provinces) government referred to two notorious cases of poisoning in the province in recent years - one the Orme murder, the other the Fullam-Clark case,"" he writes in the book.', ""True crime remains a fascinating genre and continues to captivate audiences through films, podcasts and web shows.

A federal minister of the governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) told a local news channel, ""What is the harm in writing in Kannada, apart from English? This is not England"".', 'None of this came as a surprise because in India - home to more than 300 languages - assertion of linguistic identities is common. For instance, pro-Tamil language protesters in Karnataka\'s neighbouring state Tamil Nadu have used the slogan ""Tamil Nadu is for Tamils"" since the 1930s.', 'After India won its independence in 1947, several states in the country were formed along linguistic lines by grouping together regions which spoke the same language. Karnataka was one such state formed in 1956.', 'KRV, which tore down the English billboards last month, has been claiming for decades that Kannada and its speakers have been relegated to the margins in the cosmopolitan city where people from across the country, and the world, work and live. In Bengaluru, four out of 10 people come from outside the city, reports say, although two-thirds of this population come from within the state.', 'While the influx of migrants has made some local people think that they would soon become a minority in the city, KRV\'s ""Kannada first"" demand springs from a linguistic nationalism that has been in the making for decades. Cultural historian Janaki Nair says in a research paper that Kannada speakers first demanded a separate state in the 1920s.', 'Ms Nair notes that, at first, Kannada nationalists were accommodative of other languages, including English. One of the Kannada nationalists even said that ""English is our cultural and political language, Sanskrit our spiritual and classical language and Kannada our native and speaking language"", she writes.', '""In the beginning, this linguistic agitation was never muscular as it mainly asked for the development of the language and literature. Of late, vigorous protests have taken over the movement,"" Kannada scholar Muzaffar Assadi told the BBC.', 'The strident protests started in the 1980s and before protesting against English, Kannada nationalists took on other Indian languages - Sanskrit, Tamil, Urdu and Hindi - scholars say.', 'The first of the vigorous protests was the Gokak agitation of 1982 which demanded that Kannada be made the sole first language in schools instead of Sanskrit. The Kannada film industry supported this protest, with superstar Rajkumar spearheading the movement.', 'This was followed by protests against Tamil Nadu in 1991 which gripped Bengaluru and Mysuru cities. The dispute was over sharing of water in the Cauvery river which courses through both the states. Neither Tamil speakers nor Kannada speakers wanted the other to have the larger water share.', 'Later, in 1996, major protests broke out when state broadcaster Doordarshan started programming in Urdu language. A decade later, in 2017, Kannada nationalists led by KRV, took on Hindi. The protesters demanded removal of Hindi from signages and public announcements on Bengaluru Metro line. ""Namma Metro, Hindi Beda,"" meaning \'no Hindi in our Metro\' trended for days on social media.', ""Kannada nationalists started protesting against English only after India's IT boom started in the 1990s and the demand for for English-speaking workers rose."", 'There was a general anxiety among many Kannadigas that English speakers from other states were taking away their jobs, and KRV started demanding the implementation of quotas or affirmative action for ""sons of the soil"", as recommended by the Sarojini Mahishi committee of the 1980s.', ""KRV officials say they support regional languages over others as India's federalism is rooted in regional autonomy and English signages get in the way of that.

177,Bihar men conned by 'impregnating women' job scam,Scammers in Bihar state promised to pay huge sums of money to men to get childless women pregnant.,"('Wed, 10 Jan 2024 00:00:22 GMT',)",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-67860456?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,BBC News - India,"[""All India Pregnant Job service: Indian men conned by 'impregnating women' scam"", 'Read more India stories from the BBC:', 'Related Topics', 'Top Stories', 'Features', 'Elsewhere on the BBC', 'Most Read', 'BBC News Services']","['As cyber scams go, this one is rather unique.', 'In early December Mangesh Kumar (name changed) was scrolling on Facebook when he came across a video from the ""All India Pregnant Job Service"" and decided to check it out.', 'The job sounded too good to be true: money - and lots of it - in return for getting a woman pregnant.', 'It was, of course, too good to be true. So far, the 33-year-old, who earns 15,000 rupees ($180; £142) per month working for a wedding party decoration company, has already lost 16,000 rupees to fraudsters - and they are asking for more.', 'But Mangesh, from the northern Indian state of Bihar, is not the only person to fall for the scam.', ""Deputy superintendent of police Kalyan Anand, who heads the cyber cell in Bihar's Nawada district, told the BBC there were hundreds of victims of an elaborate con where gullible men were lured to part with their cash on the promise of a huge pay day, and a night in a hotel with a childless woman."", 'So far, his team have arrested eight men, seized nine mobile phones and a printer, and are still searching for 18 others.', 'But finding the victims has proved more tricky.', '""The gang has been active for a year and we believe they have conned hundreds of people, but no-one has so far come forward to complain, possibly because of shame,"" he explained.', ""The BBC has managed to speak to two of the victims - one said he had lost 799 rupees, but didn't want to discuss details. Mangesh was much more forthcoming and, over the course of several phone calls, revealed how he fell prey to the scammers."", '""Ten minutes after I\'d clicked on the video, my phone rang. The man asked me to pay 799 rupees if I wanted to register for the job,"" he told me.', 'The caller - Mangesh calls him Sandeep sir - told him that he would be working for a company in Mumbai and that once he had signed up, he would be sent details of the woman he would have to impregnate.', 'They offered him half a million rupees - almost three years wages - just to have sex with the woman and promised further reward of 800,000 rupees if she conceived.', '""I\'m a poor man, I desperately need money so I believed them,"" the father of two young boys told me.', 'Over the next couple of weeks, Mangesh was asked to fork out more than 16,000 rupees - 2,550 rupees to obtain some court documents, 4,500 as safety deposit and 7,998 rupees as Goods and Services Tax (GST) on the money he was going to get.', 'He\'s shared all the receipts and the fake court papers with me - the official-looking document has his name and carries his photograph along with that of a man in police uniform. In big capital letters on top, it says ""Baby Birth Agreement"" and the fine print below reads ""pregnancy verification form"".', 'The signature at the end of the document resembles one used by US talk show host Oprah Winfrey.', 'The scammers kept him interested by sending him photos of ""seven-eight women"", asking him to choose the one he would like to impregnate. ""They said they would book a hotel room in the town where I lived and I would meet the woman there,"" he said.', ""When Mangesh kept asking for the promised money, they sent him a receipt saying they had credited his bank account with 512,400 rupees but the money was on hold and would be paid after he'd paid 12,600 as income tax."", ""By then, Mangesh says, he had lost an entire month's salary and told them that he couldn't pay any more and asked for a refund."", '""But Sandeep sir refused and when I got angry, he told me that since my bank account showed a credit of 500,000 rupees, income-tax authorities would raid my home and arrest me.', '""I\'m a poor labourer, I\'d lost a month\'s pay and I didn\'t want to get tangled in any criminal case. I was so afraid that I switched off my phone for 10 days. I switched it back on only a few days ago,"" he told me, adding that he initially also took me to be a part of the scammers\' gang.', 'According to DSP Anand, the men behind the scam are  educated - some are even graduates - and they know how to work mobile phones, laptops and printers. The victims, on the other hand, are from all over India and most have little education.', 'Mangesh says it didn\'t strike him that this could be a con because ""Sandeep sir"" had sent him copies of his identity cards, including one which identified him as an Indian army soldier. He also believed that the display photo on the caller\'s WhatsApp - showing an attractive foreign woman cradling a newborn in her arms - was genuine.', '""You tell me how can you not believe that photo?"" he asks.', 'The problem is, cyber law expert Pavan Duggal explains, that people in India, ""are by and large very trusting and rarely do an independent verification of information on the internet"", bolstered by an overconfidence in their safety.', 'However, the methodology of the scam in Nawada, he says, ""is very novel"".', '""The scammers lured them with promise of free money and free sex which is a deadly combination. In situations like these, prudence often takes a backseat.""', 'But with the advent of Covid-19 - when cellular and net banking became the norm - Mr Duggal says ""the golden age of cyber crime began"" and warns that ""it will go on for decades"".', 'As cyber criminals come up with newer, innovative and more customised offerings, India will have to work harder to protect people like Mangesh from falling prey to scammers, he adds.', '""The government needs to do a lot more to create awareness through radio and television broadcasts since people trust the government more.""', ""But the government alone cannot reach each one of India's 1.4 billion people."", '""The numbers are overwhelming. And depending on the government alone will take a very long time and the Indian economy will continue to bleed. So the government must give incentives to the private sector to pitch in,"" he says.', ""The scammers, meanwhile, still haven't given up on Mangesh."", 'While on a call with me last week, he rang off saying ""the madam"" was calling. This, he later explained to me, was the woman he had been promised a meeting with.', 'On Sunday night, he told me he had been speaking to her almost daily.', 'She\'s now telling him that ""Sandeep sir"" is the real conman and he\'s pilfered most of the 500,000 rupees Mangesh had been promised, but that he can still get 90,000 rupees if he pays 3,000 rupees as GST.', '""I told her I\'m broke. I pleaded with her to return my money but she said it won\'t be possible. I wish she would at least return 10,000 rupees,"" he told me.', 'I ask him if he still trusts the scammers.', '""I really don\'t know what to do now. I\'ve lost an entire month\'s pay and have not been able to send any money to my family in Bihar. My wife is very angry and no longer speaks to me.""', 'He\'s angry that ""Sandeep sir"" no longer takes his call.', '""Those who cheated me must get the maximum punishment.

Tourism accounts for almost one third of the country's economy."", 'The ministers, who have since been suspended, had called Mr Modi a ""clown"", a ""terrorist"" and a ""puppet of Israel"" on social media.', 'The comments sparked outrage and boycott calls against Maldives on Indian social media.', 'The controversial posts were deleted following the uproar and the Maldivian foreign ministry put out a statement saying the comments made by the ministers were personal and did not represent the views of the government.', ""The Maldives consists of about 1,200 coral islands and atolls located in the middle of the Indian Ocean. The archipelago has a population of about 520,000 compared to India's 1.4 billion."", 'As a small island nation, the country depends on its giant neighbour India for most of its food, infrastructure building, and technological advancement.', 'Several residents in Male say they are worried the diplomatic spat could hamper relations between the two countries.', '""We were disappointed with the boycott calls [from India]. But we were more disappointed with our government. There was a lack of good judgement on the part of our officials"", Mariyam Eem Shafeeg, a student at the Maldivian National University told the BBC.', 'Others point out that Maldives also has strong cultural ties with India as people there grow up watching Bollywood films and dramas.', '""We also depend on India for food, education and healthcare, Ms Shafeeg, a supporter of Maldivian Democratic Party, added. The Maldivian Democratic Party has had a ""India first"" policy and is believed to have close ties with Delhi.', ""The three Maldivian officials made the controversial comments in response to Mr Modi's post on X (formerly Twitter) which included photos promoting tourism to the Indian island chain of Lakshadweep."", 'Following the uproar, many Indians on social media said they were cancelling their holiday plans in the Maldives.', 'Shortly after, the CEO of Indian ticket-booking site EaseMyTrip announced that his company had suspended all flight bookings to the country.', 'Abdulla Ghiyas, president of the Maldives association of travel agents and tour operators, said there have not been a lot of cancellations at resorts and hotels. ""But we have seen some sort of slowdown in bookings,"" he added.', ""The entire controversy has erupted at a time when the Maldivian president Mohamed Muizzu has embarked on a state visit to Beijing. Mr Muizzu, who's known for his pro-China policy, has requested Beijing to send more tourists to Maldives."", 'Chinese tourists used to dominate visitors to the Maldives before the Covid-19 pandemic. But tour operators say the number has dropped significantly, perhaps due to high ticket prices and fewer flights.', '""China was our number one market pre-Covid, and it is my request that we intensify efforts for China to regain this position,"" Mr Muizzu said during his visit.', 'But several Maldivians have criticised Mr Muizzu for not taking stronger action against the three lawmakers for their controversial remarks.', '""The ministers should have been sacked straightaway. We are worried now about India\'s reaction as we depend on our neighbour for most of our food items,"" Aik Ahmed Easa, a lawyer affiliated with the opposition told the BBC.', 'The Confederation of All India Traders, one of the biggest trade bodies in the country, has asked its members to stop doing business with the Maldives until the authorities there issue an apology.', ""Many, however, point out that calls for a boycott could also affect Indians who live in the Maldives. It is estimated that around 33,000 Indians work in the country's construction, hospitality and retail sectors."", '""A significant number of Indians are also working in the Maldives tourism sector, many of them as managers and front office staff,"" Mr Ghiyas said.', 'Already, there is tension between India and the island nation after Mr Muizzu asked a contingent of 77 Indian troops to leave the country after he came to power in November last year.', 'India says its security personnel are in the island nation to maintain three maritime rescue and surveillance aircraft it had donated to the country.', ""The Indian Ocean archipelago has long been under India's sphere of influence and analysts say Mr Muizzu wants to change that. His election campaign was centred on 'India out' policy, with a promise to send Indian troops home and reduce Delhi's influence."", '""Mr Muizzu\'s rhetoric really reinforced anti-India sentiment within his voter base. That possibly could have encouraged the junior ministers to make such controversial statements openly against India,"" Azim Zahir, a Maldivian political analyst, said.', 'Though many in the Maldives say they reject the ""disrespectful"" comments on India and Mr Modi, there\'s also an argument that any possible coercive diplomatic action by Delhi could backfire.', '""It could push Mr Muizzu further towards China or any other power in the region"" Mr Zahir said.', 'A former senior Indian diplomat, Nirupama Menon Rao, said Delhi could have stepped in to reassure Male amid calls for economic boycott on social media.', '""This is where we need Indian government spokesmen to step in and course correct keeping larger, and crucial, security and strategic interests in mind.
