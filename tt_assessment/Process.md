Here i explain the process (For personal Use)



Data Extraction:

Done Scraping the RSS feed.
Substituted Title detail when summary was not present, its a little bit of a business decision, but anyway
Noticed some missing dates. Possible solution, Visit links and scrape the publish dates (This will come under refinement and not something i want to do when i have a deadline)

Scraped all the content as well. noticed that a specific group of articles had blocked bot access or python access, if needed at a later time, this can be revisited with the help of selenium, but at the moment.... proceeding with the rest


Creating a Database: Unfortunately a Dataframe isnt along term solution




Post Processing:




User Experience:






























I do this to ensure i didnt miss anything or explored any avenues
