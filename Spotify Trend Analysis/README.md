# Spotify Data Analysis

This project analyzes Spotify data to understand what makes a song popular and how song features change over time.

### Analyzing Song Popularity Trends on Spotify

I leveraged Spotify's rich song feature dataset which i found from kaggle to uncover insights into the elements that make songs popular and how listener preferences have evolved over time.

### Methods
My analysis included diverse statistical techniques including correlation analysis, linear regression, and time series forecasting models. By applying these methods, I was able to infer specific song attributes that users like. In addition, modeling streaming counts as a weekly time series revealed telling seasonal patterns and preference shifts.

### Key Findings
The most predictive signals of hit potential proved to be a mix of higher energy, danceability, loudness and lower acousticness. Positive allure of uptempo, lively songs is heightened within the context of social listening platforms like Spotify and Instagram. I also found danceability and energy levels rising progressively over the past decade - which makes perfect sense.


## Conclusion
- Useful insights into song popularity and changing trends
- Can guide music production and marketing decisions
- Provides baseline for recommendation system improvements
