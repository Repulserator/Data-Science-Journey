# Whatsapp Scraper


### Why?

Blessed with peers boasting exceptional music preferences, I found myself in a weekly ritual of accumulating a substantial list of songs. To make this process easier, I leveraged the use of popular libraries such as youtube-dl and spot-dl to download and have a seamless listening experience

### Instructions

Export your whatsapp chats and paste it in the text file (2 samples have been provided)
Then simply run the notebook, of course you will require the libraries.\ 

<li> yt-dlp
<li> ffmpeg
<li> spotdl
<li> pandas
<li> numpy
<li> pyfiglet

It should be fairly straightforward (First 2 cells) and boom, see the magic happen

### Future

Although it has served its purpose for the moment, I still wish to add 

A routine method so that it can extract chats from whatsapp directly

Add it to the task scheduler so it runs this routinely





While effective for the current needs, I would still like to make some improvements.

<li> Introducing a routine method to directly extract chats from WhatsApp

<li> Integrate into the task scheduler for automated and regular execution.

<li> Convert it to a python file for future incorporations
