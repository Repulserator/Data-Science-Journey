## UVW Assessment 

This was a data scraping and NLP asseessment. It takes multiple links of similar format and scrapes them using beautiful soup. For testing purposes i have also allowed for a shorter demo version which take considerably less time. You can also define your custom set of stopwords.

Almost every necessary explanation has been explained in the comments of the code\

Requirements to run the python file are given just in case

### Important 

If/When you run the program, it will ask you for the files path, ideally place it in the folder with input file stopword and masterdictionary folders. In case it isnt places there it will ask you to specify the path to the folder.\
Proceed and the output will be generated.

Thank you,
