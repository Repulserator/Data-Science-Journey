### GDP Analysis Using Python

This project analyzes global economic data to understand factors influencing GDP (Gross Domestic Product) per capita across countries.

We gathered data on population, birth rate, agriculture, and other attributes for over 200 countries. After cleaning the datasets, we visualized correlations and trends.

Machine learning models like linear regression and random forest regression were trained to predict GDP per capita. The random forest model performed best with 91% accuracy.

Key Findings
- Population and land area have the highest correlation with total GDP
- Agriculture, birth rate, and climate correlate with GDP per capita
- Luxembourg leads in GDP per capita, while USA, China, Japan and Germany lead in total GDP


#### Conclusion

The analysis shows that population, agriculture, birth rate, and land area are key drivers of economic productivity. The machine learning models reliably predict GDP helping policy makers determine factors to boost growth.


#### Future

There plans to eventually publish it as paper after exploring a few more problem statements that could potentially give better insights into the whole problem

One food for thought for example was to link data of Banks against this to see how much they affect a countrys GDP and How.
