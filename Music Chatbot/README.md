### Music Chatbot

I have created a chatbot using Python that can pull data on musicians from Wikipedia and have cool conversations about music artists. It demonstrates natural language capabilities, data scraping and efforts were made to make it sound more human like. \

It processes free-form user questions through NLP techniques like lemmatization, vectorization and cosine similarity to select the most appropriate response from its database.It can also scrape in real-time to constantly keep its music knowledge base relevant to the conversation \


##### Key features:

<li> Dynamic scraping of artist data
<li> Intuitive open-ended user interaction
<li> Automated natural language responses
<li> Leverages TF-IDF, cosine similarity for response matching
<li> Supports conversations with multiple turns


Overall, this showcases Python automation of a conversational agent to deliver an engaging music Q&A experience.NLP and web scraping eliminate the need for manual content creation and updating.
