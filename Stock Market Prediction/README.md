## Stock Market Prediction

In this project, we aimed to predict the next day closing value of a stock using time series forecasting techniques. We started by gathering historical data of the stock prices, cleaning the data, and transforming it into a format suitable for modeling. We then engineered new features from the data, trained different models, and validated their accuracy on test data. Finally, we used the best-performing model to predict the next day closing value of the stock.\

Our results show that the selected model was able to closely predict the next day closing value of the stock, with interpretability which can be used to inform future investment decisions. By analyzing this data, it is possible to identify patterns and trends in the stock's performance additionally, machine learning algorithms can be applied to this data to predict future stock prices, based on patterns identified in the historical data.

### What's so good about it?

My goal was to create a model good enough to bet money on. Unfortunately, Linear Regression is not the optimal choice for this endeavor. However, my most significant takeaway was realizing the extent to which one can achieve with one of the most basic machine learning algorithms. Using this method, I directed my trial and error efforts toward feature engineering. Not only did I recognize the need for it, but I also developed a module that allows endless mixing and matching of features. Perhaps others can yield even better results with the same information provided to me.

### Approach

The classic

- Pre Process
- Choose features
- train and test data
- Validate against new data


Data was taken from Yahoo finance and the bank in question is ICICI.
